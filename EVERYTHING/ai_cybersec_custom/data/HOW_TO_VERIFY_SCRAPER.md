# HOW TO VERIFY THE SCRAPER IS ACTUALLY RUNNING

## ✅ SCRAPER STATUS

**Process ID (PID):** `5535`
**Type:** Python 3 (actual scraper, not bash wrapper)
**Started:** October 24, 2025 at 23:32 UTC
**Output Directory:** `scraped_data_continuous/`
**Log File:** `continuous_scraper.log`

---

## 🔍 VERIFICATION COMMANDS (RUN THESE YOURSELF)

### 1. Check if Process is Running

```bash
ps -p 5535
```

**What you'll see if it's running:**
```
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   5535 ?        00:00:XX python3
```

**What you'll see if it's NOT running:**
```
error: process ID out of range
```

### 2. See ALL Python Processes

```bash
ps aux | grep continuous_scraper | grep -v grep
```

**What you'll see:**
```
ubuntu   5535  X.X  X.X XXXXX XXXXX ?  S  23:32  X:XX python3 -u continuous_scraper.py
```

### 3. Watch the Log in Real-Time

```bash
cd /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data
tail -f continuous_scraper.log
```

**What you'll see:**
- Continuous updates every few seconds
- Lines like `[2025-10-24 23:XX:XX] [Cycle 1] [3/30] Scraping...`
- Messages about items collected
- If nothing new appears for 5+ minutes, it may be stuck

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching (doesn't stop the scraper)

### 4. Check Output Files Being Created

```bash
ls -lth /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data/scraped_data_continuous/
```

**What you'll see:**
- Multiple `.jsonl` files
- File timestamps showing recent modifications (within last few minutes)
- File sizes growing over time

### 5. See Total Data Collected

```bash
du -sh /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data/scraped_data_continuous/
```

**What you'll see:**
- Size increasing over time (e.g., `5.2M`, `10M`, `50M`, etc.)

### 6. Check How Many Items Collected

```bash
cd /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data/scraped_data_continuous
wc -l *.jsonl
```

**What you'll see:**
- Line counts for each file (1 line = 1 item)
- Total at the bottom

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Scraper Not Running?

**Check PID:**
```bash
cat /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data/continuous_scraper.pid
ps -p $(cat /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data/continuous_scraper.pid)
```

**Restart if needed:**
```bash
cd /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data
pkill -f continuous_scraper
nohup python3 -u continuous_scraper.py > continuous_scraper.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > continuous_scraper.pid
```

### Log Not Updating?

**Check last modification time:**
```bash
ls -lh continuous_scraper.log
```

If timestamp is old (>10 minutes), scraper may have crashed.

**Check last 50 lines for errors:**
```bash
tail -50 continuous_scraper.log
```

### No Output Files?

Scraper might be early in first cycle. Wait 5-10 minutes and check again.

## 📊 MONITOR PROGRESS

**Quick Status Check (run every hour):**
```bash
cd /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data
echo "PID Status:" && ps -p 5535 > /dev/null && echo "✅ Running" || echo "❌ Stopped"
echo "Data Collected:" && du -sh scraped_data_continuous/
echo "Last Log Entry:" && tail -3 continuous_scraper.log
```

**Expected Progress:**
- Hour 1: 5-20 MB
- Hour 6: 30-100 MB
- Day 1: 100-300 MB
- Week 1: 500MB-1GB
- Week 4: 2-4 GB (enough for 200M model)

---

## 🛑 STOP SCRAPER

```bash
# Find PID
cat /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data/continuous_scraper.pid

# Stop gracefully (allows it to finish current task)
kill $(cat /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data/continuous_scraper.pid)

# Force stop if it doesn't stop
kill -9 $(cat /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data/continuous_scraper.pid)

# Or kill all Python processes (nuclear option)
pkill -9 python3
```

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS (as of now)

Run this to see current status:
```bash
cd /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/data
echo "============================================"
echo "CONTINUOUS SCRAPER STATUS"
echo "============================================"
ps -p 5535 > /dev/null && echo "Status: ✅ RUNNING" || echo "Status: ❌ STOPPED"
echo "PID: $(cat continuous_scraper.pid 2>/dev/null || echo 'NO PID FILE')"
echo "Data Size: $(du -sh scraped_data_continuous/ 2>/dev/null | cut -f1)"
echo "Files: $(ls scraped_data_continuous/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Last Activity:"
tail -5 continuous_scraper.log 2>/dev/null
echo "============================================"
```
