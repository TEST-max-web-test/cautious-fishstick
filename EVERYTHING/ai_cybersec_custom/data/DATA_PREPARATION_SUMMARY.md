# Training Data Preparation - Complete ✅

## Summary

All training data has been successfully combined into a single corpus file ready for training.

## Data Sources Combined

### 1. Original Q&A Corpus (`corpus.txt`)
- **Size:** 165 KB
- **Items:** 297 Q&A conversation pairs
- **Format:** User/Agent question-answer pairs
- **Content:** Cybersecurity concepts and techniques

### 2. Filtered Security Documents (`consolidated_training_data.jsonl`)
- **Size:** 45 MB (42.09 MB content)
- **Items:** 619 high-quality documents
- **Sources:** 24+ GitHub security repositories
- **Content:** Security guides, CTF writeups, penetration testing, vulnerability research

## Combined Corpus Statistics

**File:** `combined_corpus.txt`
- **Total Size:** 42.47 MB (43 MB on disk)
- **Total Items:** 916 source items (297 Q&A + 619 docs)
- **Training Blocks:** 24,047 valid text blocks (after splitting and filtering)
- **Total Characters:** 44,297,611
- **Content Breakdown:**
  - Q&A pairs: 0.4%
  - Security documents: 99.6%

## Data Quality

✅ **Filtered** - All data has been through quality filtering:
- Removed files < 200 characters
- Removed config files, templates, licenses
- Kept only security-relevant content (vulnerability, exploit, CTF keywords)
- 46.6% rejection rate from raw scraped data

✅ **Formatted** - Consistent format:
- Q&A pairs in conversational format
- Documents with metadata headers
- All UTF-8 encoded

✅ **Ready** - Training script updated:
- Uses `combined_corpus.txt`
- Handles both Q&A and document formats
- Tokenization tested and working

## Training Configuration

The training script (`train.py`) is now configured to use the combined corpus:

```python
corpus_path = os.path.join(script_dir, '../data/combined_corpus.txt')
```

The `TextDataset` class has been updated to:
- Load all text blocks from the combined corpus
- Skip blocks < 50 characters
- Tokenize each block into training samples
- Create 24,047 training samples

## Next Steps

To train the model:

```bash
cd /workspace/EVERYTHING/ai_cybersec_custom/train
python3 train.py
```

The model will train on:
- **24,047 training samples**
- **42.47 MB of cybersecurity content**
- Mix of conversational Q&A and technical security documentation

## Files Created

1. `combine_corpus.py` - Script to combine all data sources
2. `combined_corpus.txt` - Final combined training corpus (42.47 MB)
3. Updated `train.py` - Training script using combined corpus

## Data Coverage

The training data covers:
- ✅ Web application security (XSS, CSRF, SQLi, etc.)
- ✅ Network penetration testing
- ✅ Privilege escalation (Linux & Windows)
- ✅ CTF techniques and writeups
- ✅ Bug bounty hunting methodologies
- ✅ Cloud security (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes)
- ✅ Mobile security testing
- ✅ Reverse engineering basics
- ✅ Exploit development concepts
- ✅ Security tool usage
