Can be used for any functionality provided with Mimikatz.\n\n#### `Get-Keystrokes`\n\nLogs keys pressed, time and the active window.\n\n#### `Get-GPPPassword`\n\nRetrieves the plaintext password and other information for accounts pushed through Group Policy Preferences.\n\n#### `Get-GPPAutologon`\n\nRetrieves autologon username and password from registry.xml if pushed through Group Policy Preferences.\n\n#### `Get-TimedScreenshot`\n\nA function that takes screenshots at a regular interval and saves them to a folder.\n\n#### `New-VolumeShadowCopy`\n\nCreates a new volume shadow copy.\n\n#### `Get-VolumeShadowCopy`\n\nLists the device paths of all local volume shadow copies.\n\n#### `Mount-VolumeShadowCopy`\n\nMounts a volume shadow copy.\n\n#### `Remove-VolumeShadowCopy`\n\nDeletes a volume shadow copy.\n\n#### `Get-VaultCredential`\n\nDisplays Windows vault credential objects including cleartext web credentials.\n\n#### `Out-Minidump`\n\nGenerates a full-memory minidump of a process.\n\n#### `Get-MicrophoneAudio`\n\nRecords audio from system microphone and saves to disk\n\n## Mayhem\n\n**Cause general mayhem with PowerShell.**\n\n#### `Set-MasterBootRecord`\n\nProof of concept code that overwrites the master boot record with the\n message of your choice.\n\n#### `Set-CriticalProcess`\n\nCauses your machine to blue screen upon exiting PowerShell.\n\n## Privesc\n\n**Tools to help with escalating privileges on a target.**\n\n#### `PowerUp`\n\nClearing house of common privilege escalation checks, along with some weaponization vectors.\n\n## Recon\n\n**Tools to aid in the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test.**\n\n#### `Invoke-Portscan`\n\nDoes a simple port scan using regular sockets, based (pretty) loosely on nmap.\n\n#### `Get-HttpStatus`\n\nReturns the HTTP Status Codes and full URL for specified paths when provided with a dictionary file.\n\n#### `Invoke-ReverseDnsLookup`\n\nScans an IP address range for DNS PTR records.\n\n#### `PowerView`\n\nPowerView is series of functions that performs network and Windows domain enumeration and exploitation.\n\n## Recon\\Dictionaries\n\n**A collection of dictionaries used to aid in the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test. Dictionaries were taken from the following sources.**\n\n* admin.txt - <http://cirt.net/nikto2/>\n* generic.txt - <http://sourceforge.net/projects/yokoso/files/yokoso-0.1/>\n* sharepoint.txt - <http://www.stachliu.com/resources/tools/sharepoint-hacking-diggity-project/>\n\n## License\n\nThe PowerSploit project and all individual scripts are under the [BSD 3-Clause license](https://raw.github.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/LICENSE) unless explicitly noted otherwise.\n\n## Usage\n\nRefer to the comment-based help in each individual script for detailed usage information.\n\nTo install this module, drop the entire PowerSploit folder into one of your module directories. The default PowerShell module paths are listed in the $Env:PSModulePath environment variable.\n\nThe default per-user module path is: \"$Env:HomeDrive$Env:HOMEPATH\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\"\nThe default computer-level module path is: \"$Env:windir\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\"\n\nTo use the module, type `Import-Module PowerSploit`\n\nTo see the commands imported, type `Get-Command -Module PowerSploit`\n\nIf you're running PowerShell v3 and you want to remove the annoying 'Do you really want to run scripts downloaded from the Internet' warning, once you've placed PowerSploit into your module path, run the following one-liner:\n`$Env:PSModulePath.Split(';') |\n % { if ( Test-Path (Join-Path $_ PowerSploit) )\n {Get-ChildItem $_ -Recurse | Unblock-File} }`\n\nFor help on each individual command, Get-Help is your friend.\n\nNote: The tools contained within this module were all designed such that they can be run individually. Including them in a module simply lends itself to increased portability.\n\n## Contribution Rules\n\nWe need contributions! If you have a great idea for PowerSploit, we'd love to add it. New additions will require the following:\n\n* The script must adhere to the style guide. Any exceptions to the guide line would need an explicit, valid reason.\n* The module manifest needs to be updated to reflect the new function being added.\n* A brief description of the function should be added to this README.md\n* Pester tests must accompany all new functions. See the Tests folder for examples but we are looking for tests that at least cover the basics by testing for expected/unexpected input/output and that the function exhibits desired functionality. Make sure the function is passing all tests (preferably in mutiple OSes) prior to submitting a pull request. Thanks!\n\n## Script Style Guide\n\n**For all contributors and future contributors to PowerSploit, I ask that you follow this style guide when writing your scripts/modules.**\n\n* Avoid Write-Host **at all costs**. PowerShell functions/cmdlets are not command-line utilities! Pull requests containing code that uses Write-Host will not be considered. You should output custom objects instead. For more information on creating custom objects, read these articles:\n   * <http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2011/05/19/create-custom-objects-in-your-powershell-script.aspx>\n   * <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff730946.aspx>\n\n* If you want to display relevant debugging information to the screen, use Write-Verbose. The user can always just tack on '-Verbose'.\n\n* Always provide descriptive, comment-based help for every script. Also, be sure to include your name and a BSD 3-Clause license (unless there are extenuating circumstances that prevent the application of the BSD license).\n\n* Make sure all functions follow the proper PowerShell verb-noun agreement. Use Get-Verb to list the default verbs used by PowerShell. Exceptions to supported verbs will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n* I prefer that variable names be capitalized and be as descriptive as possible.\n\n* Provide logical spacing in between your code. Indent your code to make it more readable.\n\n* If you find yourself repeating code, write a function.\n\n* Catch all anticipated errors and provide meaningful output. If you have an error that should stop execution of the script, use 'Throw'. If you have an error that doesn't need to stop execution, use Write-Error.\n\n* If you are writing a script that interfaces with the Win32 API, try to avoid compiling C# inline with Add-Type. Try to use the PSReflect module, if possible.\n\n* Do not use hardcoded paths. A script should be useable right out of the box. No one should have to modify the code unless they want to.\n\n* PowerShell v2 compatibility is highly desired.\n\n* Use positional parameters and make parameters mandatory when it makes sense to do so. For example, I'm looking for something like the following:\n   * `[Parameter(Position = 0, Mandatory = $True)]`\n\n* Don't use any aliases unless it makes sense for receiving pipeline input. They make code more difficult to read for people who are unfamiliar with a particular alias.\n\n* Try not to let commands run on for too long. For example, a pipeline is a natural place for a line break.\n\n* Don't go overboard with inline comments. Only use them when certain aspects of the code might be confusing to a reader.\n\n* Rather than using Out-Null to suppress unwanted/irrelevant output, save the unwanted output to $null. Doing so provides a slight performance enhancement.\n\n* Use default values for your parameters when it makes sense. Ideally, you want a script that will work without requiring any parameters.\n\n* If a script creates complex custom objects, include a ps1xml file that will properly format the object's output.\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T22:06:57.054674"}
