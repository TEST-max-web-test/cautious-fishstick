Let say you found a RPO (Relativce Path Overwrite) in a website, but you have no idea how should you exploit that, then the perfect place to go would be [here](http://blog.innerht.ml/rpo-gadgets/). Or you have found your customer is using oauth mechanism but you have no idea how should we test it, the other perfect place to go would be [here](https://whitton.io/articles/obtaining-tokens-outlook-office-azure-account/)\n\nMy intention is to make a full and complete list of common vulnerability that are publicly disclosed bug bounty write-up, and let Bug Bounty Hunter to use this page as a reference when they want to gain some insight for a particular kind of vulnerability during Bug Hunting, feel free to submit pull request. Okay, enough for chit-chatting, let's get started. \n\n\n- [XSSI](#xssi)\n- [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](#cross-site-scripting-xss)\n- [Brute Force](#brute-force)\n- [SQL Injection
