Database protection in Defender for Cloud contains four flavors, dependong on which database type you are looking to protect. \n\n1. Defender for SQL Paas (SQL on Azure VM)\n<br> Vulnerability assessment and threat protection is available for this plan. Read more about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-introduction). \n2. Defender for SQL on machines (SQL servers hosted on premise, in Azure, AWS or GCP)\n<br>For this plan, Azure Monitoring Agent (AMA) is required, in place of Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA). Read more about this [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-usage). Vulnerability assessment and detecting anomalous activities are available to protect your Iaas SQL Servers.\n3. Defender for Open-source relational database\n<br> Protect your PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB resources by detecting anomalous activities. Read more about these security alerts [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-introduction).\n4. Defender for Cosmos DB (NoSQL)\n<br>Detect potential threats against Cosmos DB accounts like SQL injection, compromised identities or potential exploitation. Read more about CosmosDB protection [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-defender-for-cosmos). \n\n### Exercise 1: Create a SQL Server on an Azure VM, enable Defender for SQL servers on machines plan and validate alerts\n\nTo enable the Defender plan on a specific subscription:\n1.\tSign into the **Azure portal**.\n2.\tNavigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, then **Environment settings**.\n3.\tSelect the relevant subscription.\n4.

You can view the outbound URLs [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/network-requirements?tabs=azure-cloud#urls).\r\n\r\n6. In the **Resource details**, fill in the following info (change it as necessary):\r\n\r\n![Arc](../Images/arcserverdetails.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nNote: for the connectivity method, select what‚Äôs most appropriate for your environment. As this is a test server in my case, I‚Äôm leaving it as Public endpoint.\r\n\r\n7. Add a tag if you choose, and click **Next**.\r\n\r\n![Arc](../Images/arctag.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n8. In the **Download and run script** page, copy the script to your clipboard.\r\n\r\n9. Go back to your VM (start it if it's not already running).\r\n\r\n10. Search for **Powershell ISE**, and right-click it and select **Run as administrator**.\r\n\r\n![Arc](../Images/powershelladmin.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Now that Powershell is open, Create a new file, and paste the Arc script (that we copied earlier) directly into this file, and then press run.\r\n\r\n12. As the script runs, the VM's default browser should appear asking you to authenticate into your Azure subscription (where we will be connecting this server to). Sign in to your Azure subscription.\r\n\r\n13. Once script has completed, the Azure Arc agent has been deployed and configured onto the server. \r\n\r\nThis means that your Azure subscription, will be able to detect this server after approximately 24 hours. This VM will act as an on-premises server in Azure, and it will be protected by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\r\n\r\n## Exercise 8: Confirm that the \"on-prem\" server we created is being detected by the Azure portal\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Azure Portal, and search for the resource group where you created the Arc server earlier.\r\n\r\n2. Notice that your machine will be there (with a different name).\r\n\r\n![Arc](../Images/rg.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n3. You will need to wait for approximately 24 hours after installing the Arc agent on the VM before the VM appears in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\r\n\r\n![Inventory in MDC](../Images/mdcinventory.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. From Inventory, click into the server name to open up **Resource Health** about that server. Then in the Resource Health, click again on the server name on the top-left hand corner. This will bring you to the Arc resource.\r\n\r\n5. From the Arc resource, go to **Extensions**, and there you will notice that the agents have been installed automatically.\r\n\r\n    The MDE.Windows agent refers to the MDE (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) capabilities.\r\n\r\n    The AzureSecurityWindowsAgent refers to the AMA (Azure Monitor Agent), which is due to my auto-provisioning settings in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. See more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview) for the Azure Microsoft Agent.\r\n\r\n    [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/manage-vm-extensions) is a link for all possible Azure Arc extensions.\r\n\r\n![Arc VM Extensions](../Images/extensionsInArcVM.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nNote: You should install the log analytics agent/ Azure Monitor Agent on the machine in order for it to be protected by Microsoft Defender for Servers as part of Microsoft Defender for Cloud automatically. See more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent) for the log analytics agent. \r\n\r\n! Please be aware that the Log Analytics agent is on a deprecation path and won't be supported after August 31, 2024. If you use the Log Analytics agent to ingest data to Azure Monitor, [migrate to the new Azure Monitor agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-migration) prior to that date. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Now you have successfully onboarded a server outside of Azure to Microsoft Defender for Cloud by using Azure Arc.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### A possible next step to get more familiar with Azure Arc is to follow the guidance in the micro-hack [here](https://github.com/microsoft/MicroHack/tree/main/03-Azure/01-03-Infrastructure/02_Hybrid_Azure_Arc_Servers).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n### Further Links\r\n[Best practise configuration management for Azure Arc enabled servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/hybrid/azure-arc-hybrid-config)\r\n\r\n[Azure automanage for Arc-enabled servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automanage/automanage-arc)\r\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:28.618481"}

Please allow this time for the initial data collection and analysis to complete, then return to review the results.\n\n ## Use-case for the exercise\n\nA hypothetical organization, \"Adatum Corporation,\" had a robust cybersecurity infrastructure in place. However, one day, an attacker used a brute force or password spraying attack to gain access to an Internet-exposed server of the organization.\n\nThe attacker could quickly move laterally through the network, exploiting vulnerabilities on the Internet-exposed servers and gaining access to the organization's Storage Accounts, SQL servers, and Key Vaults. The SOC department was alerted by Defender for Cloud on the ‚ÄúBrute Force, Password Spray‚Äù IOC/IOA, and quickly realized something was wrong when they noticed unusual activity on the servers and Storage Accounts.\n\nIn response to the attack, the security engineers leveraged the attack path analysis to identify the entry point of the attack and the path the attackers used to move laterally through the network. Based on this analysis, they were able to close the entry point and cut off the attackers' access to the organization's data.\n\nAdditionally, they utilized **Sensitive Data Discovery** to identify and secure sensitive information that could be at risk of exposure. **Permission Management** tools were implemented to review and tighten access controls, ensuring that permissions were strictly granted based on the principle of least privilege. The discovery of plaintext secrets in the environment prompted the integration of **Secret Discovery** tools to encrypt sensitive data and manage secrets more securely.\n\nThe IT department didn't stop there. They also took a proactive approach by implementing security recommendations to fix the vulnerabilities on the Internet-exposed servers and prevent similar attacks in the future. Utilizing the Risk Prioritization feature of DCSPM, the security team gained full visibility into which recommendations should be prioritized, focusing their efforts on addressing the most critical vulnerabilities first. Additionally, they implemented a robust incident response plan and conducted regular security training for employees. \n\nThanks to the combination of both reactive and proactive measures, Adatum Corporation was able to prevent a major data breach and keep their sensitive information safe. This hypothetical use case demonstrates the importance of having both a reactive and proactive approach when it comes to cybersecurity, including performing attack path and security risk analysis, implementing security recommendations, assigning/managing change actions to the proper owners, and educating employees to prevent future attacks.  \n\n## Exercise 3: Analyzing and Mitigating Attack Paths\n\nIn this exercise, we will explore the Attack Path feature of Defender CSPM. Through a hands-on scenario, you will learn how to identify and mitigate potential security breaches that exploit critical vulnerabilities and inadequate permission settings in cloud environments.\n\n### Scenario Overview\n\nAn Internet-exposed VM has been identified with High severity vulnerabilities, which includes read permissions to a key vault. This setup poses a significant risk as it may allow attackers to exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities on the server. The lack of \"least privileged\" permission configurations could enable intruders to access sensitive secrets stored in the Key Vault once the server is breached.\n\n### Objective\n\nUtilize the Attack Path feature to trace and understand how an attacker could navigate through your cloud environment and identify critical steps to mitigate this risk.\n\nThe next exercise will demonstrate how to leverage the Attack Path feature of Defender for CSPM, highlighting a critical use case where an Internet-exposed VM with High severity vulnerabilities and read permissions to a key vault presents a potential attack vector.\n\n1.\tOpen **Azure Portal** and navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** blade.\n2.\tFrom Defender for Cloud's menu, open the **Attack path analysis** page\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img01.png?raw=true)\n\n3.\tYou will find Attack path view as below:\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img02.png?raw=true)\n \n4.\tFind the Attack Path with the name **\"Internet exposed Azure VM with high severity vulnerabilities allows lateral movement to Azure Key Vault‚Äù**, and open it by clicking it\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img03.png?raw=true)\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img04.png?raw=true)\n \n5. Here, you can observe the attack path and the resources involved in the attack vector. By clicking on each node/element of the attack path, you can review detailed information from the right panel. This panel provides related insights and valuable information, helping you understand how the attack can occur and what factors contribute to the lateral movements through the resources involved.\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img05.png?raw=true)\n\n6. Remediate the recommendations to resolve the attack path. In the main Attack Path view, locate and click on the **Remediation** tab. This action opens the remediation section, which displays the specific security recommendations needed to mitigate the attack vector.\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img06.png?raw=true)\n\n7.\tExplore the rest of the Attack paths found in your Environment and remidiate\n\n## Exercise 4: Build Query with Cloud Security Explorer\n\nIn this exercise, you will utilize the Cloud Security Explorer in Microsoft Defender for Cloud to perform a type of ad-hoc risk analysis by querying and identifying risky resources within your cloud environment. You will learn how to use predefined query templates and the query builder to explore, for example, vulnerabilities, identities, and sensitive data exposures in your virtual machines and storage accounts. This hands-on experience will enhance your understanding of how to effectively search for Virtual Machines (Servers) vulnerable to Remote Code Execution, pinpoint specific vulnerabilities, and identify storage accounts with sensitive data,, or you can also expand the query to add additional condition as you like, or build a total new one.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open **Azure Portal** and navigate to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** blade.\n2. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open the **Cloud Security Explorer** page.\n\n   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102209701/215828929-98a0e9fe-1f0e-4ac8-97f5-4bed96d0d174.png)\n\n3.

Your challenge is to automate the remediation process for high-severity vulnerabilities, ensuring they are addressed promptly to maintain a robust security posture.\n\nThrough this exercise, you will configure a governance rule that ensures all high-severity vulnerabilities are remediated within 90 days, enhancing the security and compliance of your cloud environment. This process not only helps maintain your organization's security posture but also introduces a structured approach to managing cloud resources responsibly.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open **Azure Portal** and navigate to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** blade.\n2. From the Defender for Cloud's menu, open the **Environment Settings** page and select the relevant subscription.\n3. Under **Settings**, select **Governance Rules**.\n4.

This capability allows security teams to focus on the most critical issues that could impact the security posture of their cloud environments.\n\nYou are part of a security team managing cloud assets for a multinational corporation. Due to the vast number of assets and continuous deployment cycles, it is crucial to prioritize security tasks effectively. By focusing on high-risk recommendations, you can optimize your remediation efforts and allocate resources more efficiently, enhancing overall security.\n\nThis exercise aims to enhance your ability to effectively prioritize and manage the remediation of security vulnerabilities within your cloud environment. By focusing on high-risk recommendations, you can ensure that critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly, reducing the potential impact on your organization‚Äôs operations and data security.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open **Azure Portal** and navigate to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** blade.\n2. Go to the **Recommendations** section.\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img07.png?raw=true)\n\n3. Sort or filter the recommendations by risk level by clicking on the **Risk level** column to sort from Low to Critical, or vice versa. This will organize the recommendations starting from the highest to the lowest risk levels. Here, you can view multiple valuable insights as they are exposed through each column of the records. You can see the risk factors that have contributed to the risk level evaluation, the number of attack paths found for the resource, whether an owner has been assigned to its remediation, and the status of the change.\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img08.png?raw=true)\n\n\n4. Select a high-risk recommendation to view detailed information about the risk factors, affected resources, and suggested remediation steps.\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img09.png?raw=true)\n\n5. Analyze the recommendation details to understand the potential business impact and the exploitability of the vulnerability. Perhaps you can view the findings by clicking the Findings tab, or you can view all the Attack paths found associated to the resource in question.\n6. Plan and assign remediation tasks based on the priority of the risks. Use the integrated task management tools within Defender for Cloud to assign tasks to appropriate team members by clicking **Assign owner & set due date**.\n7. Monitor the progress of remediation efforts through the **Governance and Compliance** dashboard to ensure that high-risk vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n## Exercise 7: Leverage Cloud Identity Entitlement Management - Permissions Management\n\nThis exercise will guide you through the process of enabling and using Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This feature helps manage and secure identity and access configurations across your cloud environments, ensuring that permissions adhere to the principle of least privilege.\n\nAs a security administrator, you are tasked with reducing the risk of excessive permissions in your organization's cloud environments. Permissions Management allows you to track and manage entitlements efficiently, enhancing security and compliance.\n\nThis exercise aims to provide you with practical experience in managing cloud permissions, focusing on minimizing the risk associated with over-privileged identities and ensuring compliance with your organization‚Äôs security policies.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal** and navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.\n2. In the left menu, select **Management/Environment settings**.\n3. Choose the Azure subscription you want to manage and ensure the **Defender CSPM** plan is active.\n4. Under the plan settings, enable the **Permissions Management** extension.\n5. Click **Continue** and then **Save** to apply the changes. After a few minutes, you'll notice that:\n\n    - Your subscription has a new Reader assignment for the Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management application.\n\n    - The new Azure CSPM (Preview) standard is assigned to your subscription.\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img10.png?raw=true)\n\n6. After enabling, you can access the Permissions Management features through the Defender for Cloud portal.\n7. Navigate to the **Recommendations** page to view new permissions-related recommendations.\n\n![image](../Images/module17Img11.png?raw=true)\n\n8. Use the Permissions Management capabilities to analyze and adjust permissions across your Azure, AWS, or GCP resources.\n\nFor further details on enabling and using Permissions Management, refer to the official [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/enable-permissions-management).\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:28.758579"}

In Visual Studio Code, run **python ./antimalware.py**. Make sure you are in the folder where you have the python file. In this example, the file is located in Downloads.\r\n![Results](../Images/terminal5.png?raw=true)\r\n12. In the results you will see you have 2 files: \"ContosoSecretRecipe.txt\"  \r\n    and \"TotallyNotMalware.txt\". Both files were declared in your code. The  \r\n    first file was a benign one, that's why it shows a checkmark ‚úÖ right  \r\n    next to its path. The second file was an Eicar one that the Malware  \r\n    Scanning scan result identifies as malicious, that's why it has an X ‚ùå  \r\n    next to its path. In the results you will also have values such as:  \r\n    `etag`, `last_modified`, and the blob index tags with the scan result  \r\n    and the time when the scan was performed.\r\n\r\n## üìñ Exercise 9: Set up \"Send scan results to Log Analytics\" and read it\r\n> **Note:** Malware Scanning error messages were updated in August 2025.

If no results appear immediately, refresh the screen and repeat steps 8 and 9.\r\n![Log Analytics results](../Images/loganalyticsresults.png?raw=true)\r\n12. Within the results notice all of the fields available:\r\n\r\n- TimeGenerated [UTC]\r\n- CorrelationId\r\n- OperationName\r\n- StorageAccountName\r\n- BlobUri\r\n- BlobEtag\r\n- ScanFinishedTimeUtc [UTC]\r\n- ScanResultDetails\r\n- Type\r\n- _ResourceId\r\n- TenantId\r\n- SourceSystem\r\n\r\n> **Note**: it may take a few minutes for the logs to arrive.\r\n\r\n## üõ†Ô∏è Exercise 10: Function App based on Event Grid events\r\n\r\nIn this exercise we will use an Azure Function App based on Event Grid events. The Azure Function code we will use is going to help you move a malicious blob from the container where you are uploading files, to a different container (quarantine). The Event Grid events come from the Malware Scanning scan results.\r\n\r\n1. Create an Event-Grid Topic in Azure. This has to be in the same region as your Storage Account. Every time we get a scan result, this will be sent to the Event-Grid Topic and this will be able to publish it to all the subscribers (Function app in this case).\r\n    ![Event Grid creation](../Images/eventgrid1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n2. Once you have validaded all fields, click on **Create**.\r\n    ![Event Grid creation](../Images/eventgrid2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n3. Go to your storage account, click **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** on  \r\n   the left side menu, and then on **Settings**. On the right, a menu will  \r\n   pop-up. First, switch **Override Defender for Storage subscription-level  \r\n   settings** to **On**. Then, you can check the box for **Send scan results  \r\n   to Event-Grid topic** and choose from the dropbox menu, your Event-Grid.\r\n\r\n    ![Event Grid creation](../Images/eventgrid3.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n4. In the **Azure portal** create a Function App. In this example, we will have a .NET code that moves malicious files once they are scanned and found with malware. It will be in the same resource group as my Event-Grid.\r\n    ![Function App creation](../Images/functionapp1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n5. In the **Defender for Storage documentation**, you will find a code  \r\n    template [MoveMaliciousBlobEventTrigger.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan#option-2-function-app-based-on-event-grid-events)  \r\n    Copy the code. **Note:** The code was updated after this lab  \r\n    instructions. You will have to edit the value `\"InterestedContainer\"` to  \r\n    the container where you want to apply the Function App.\r\n\r\n6. Open **Visual Studio Code** in your computer and create a new function. Use **CTRL + Shift + P** to display the quick menu and look for **Azure Functions: Create Function...**\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n7. Create a new folder in your computer as soon as the option in Visual Studio Code comes out.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n8. In Visual Studio Code, you'll be requested to input the programming language for the code. In this example we will input C#.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp3.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n9. Select the runtime. Here we will put **.NET 6.0 LTS**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp5.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n10. Create a new project. Here we will put **Azure Blob storage trigger**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp6.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n11. Provide a function name. We will take the one from the code and leave it as \"MoveMaliciousBlob\".\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp7.png?raw=true)\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp8.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n12. Provide a namespace. We will input \"Company.MoveMaliciousBlob\".\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp9.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n13. Sign in to your Azure environment.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp10.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n14. Select your subscription.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp11.png?raw=true)\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp12.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n15. Input the name of one of your storage account containers, solely for the purpose to fill this section.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp13.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n16. In this newly created project, paste‚Äîin the `MoveMaliciousBlob.cs` file‚Äî\r\n    the code found in the Defender for Storage documentation called\r\n    [MoveMaliciousBlobEventTrigger.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan#option-2-function-app-based-on-event-grid-events)  \r\n    **Note:** The code was updated after this lab instructions. You will have to\r\n    edit the value `InterestedContainer = \"YourContainerName\"` to the container\r\n    where you want to apply the Function App; all files that are uploaded there\r\n    and have the Malicious tag will be moved to a new container (also defined in\r\n    this code).\r\n    ![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp14.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n17. [Optional] Download and install .NET 6.0 SDK so that you can run the code. <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0> After you do that, close and re-open Visual Studio Code so that changes are applied.\r\n\r\n18. In the local.settings.json file, copy the content between air quotes in line 6 to the air quotes in line 4.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp15.png?raw=true)\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp16.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n19. Go to the file MoveMaliciousBlob.cs and open a new terminal.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp17.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n20. Add your missing packages. In this example type: **dotnet add package Azure.Messaging.EventGrid**\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp18.png?raw=true)\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp19.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n21. Then type: **dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EventGrid**\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp20.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n22. Use F5 to start debugging and make sure you don't have any errors or missing packages. Errors most likely have to do with typos, access to the resources, or missing the .NET 6.0 SDK.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp21.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n23. Use CTRL + SHIFT + P to deploy this to the function app. Input **Azure functions deploy to function app**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp22.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n24. Select the function app in your Azure environment.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp23.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n25. In the pop-up message select **Deploy**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp24.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n26. In the **Azure portal** go to the Event-Grid you created. In the left side menu, go to **Event Subscriptions** and then click **Event Subscription**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp25.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n27. Input a name for your event subscription. In **Endpoint Type** choose **Azure Function** and then click on **Select an endpoint**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp26.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n28. In the Function app dropdown, select your function app to have everything else populated automatically. Make sure the in the last dropdown called \"Function\", the function you created (in your code it is in line 13 in the .cs file) is selected. As soon as everything is validaded, click on **Confirm Selection** and then **Create**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp27.png?raw=true)\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp28.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n29. Confirm in your Event Subscription that it appears.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp29.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n30. Let's test that the Event Grid is working. Create a new Event Subscription. In **Endpoint Type** select **Storage Queues**. Then, click on **Select an Endpoint**. Select from the dropdown your Storage Account that has Event Grid enabled. In the **Queue** section, select **Create new queue** and put any name for this. Click **Create** and then again **Create**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp30.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n31. Verify that this new Event Subscription is created. This queue will receive all the events when they are triggered.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp31.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n32. In Visual Studio Code, click on **Upload settings**. This option is there because you deployed the function app in the step 25. The notification can also be accessed from the bell icon in the bottom right corner.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp32.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n33. [Optional] If you have a message that says some settings already exist in your function app, click **Yes to all** to overwrite them.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp33.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n34. A message in the right-bottom corner of Visual Studio Code will let you know \"Successfully uploaded settings...\".\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp34.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n35. Go to the **Azure portal** and navigate to your function app to add a system assigned managed identity.\r\n\r\n36. In the left side menu, select **Identity**. In the **System assigned** tab, in the Status bundle, select **On** and then click **Save**. This will add a role assignment for this function app to access the Storage Account.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp35.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n37. Select **Yes** in the message **Enable system assigned managed identity**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp36.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n38. An object ID will be created.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp37.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n39. Navigate to your Storage Account and in the left side menu, select **Access Control (IAM)** and then click **Add** and **Add role assignment**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp38.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n40. In the **Role** tab, in the search bar, look for **Storage Blob Data Contributor**, click on it, and then click **Next**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp39.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n41. In the **Members** tab, in **Assign access to**, select **Managed Identity** and then click on **Select members**. A pop-up menu on the right will let you choose your function app. Click **Select**, and then **Review + Assign**.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp40.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n42. Let's create a new container in the Storage Account to test this out. In the left side of your Storage Account menu, click on **Containers**. Then click on **Container** and put any name.\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp41.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n43. Upload an EICAR file and a benign file. Your function app might take a few minutes to kick in.\r\n![Function App code test](../Images/codefunctionapp42.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n44. [Optional] Let's test everything works. Go to your Event Grid and in the **Event Subscriptions** click on the one for queues. Here we will see that the events are being reported.\r\n![Event grid test](../Images/codefunctionapp43.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n45. [Optional] You can go back to the Storage Account and in the left side menu, click on **Queues** and select the queue you created. In the **Overview** tab you will see a list of events of that Storage Account.\r\n![Storage Account Queue](../Images/queueevent.png?raw=true)\r\n![Storage Account Queue](../Images/queueevent2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n46. [Optional] Test the function app. Go to the function app and in the left menu click on **Functions**. Then click on your function.\r\n![Function App code test](../Images/codefunctionapp44.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n47. [Optional] In the left menu, click on **Monitor** to see if you have any logs.\r\n![Function App monitor](../Images/codefunctionapp45.png?raw=true)\r\n![Function App monitor](../Images/monitorinvocations.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n48. In your EICAR file that was uploaded, when you click on it, you should see a **404** error. This means the function app worked correctly and moved the malicious file to a container called **malware** (defined in the MoveMaliciousBlob.cs code in line 17).\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp46.png?raw=true)\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp47.png?raw=true)\r\n![Function App code](../Images/codefunctionapp48.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise 11: ABAC for users not to read malicious files\r\n\r\nTo make sure that your apps and users can only read non-malicious files, which means that Defender for Storage found without threats, you can implement Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). In this exercise we will explore how you can have roles that have a condition to only read the files that have no threats found.\r\n\r\n1. In the **Azure portal**, navigate to your Storage Account you are testing.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n2. Click on **Access Control (IAM)**, navigate to **Role Assignments** and click on **+ Add** that is on the top.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac2.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n3. Select **Add role assignment**.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac3.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n4. In roles, type **Blob data contributor** and select it. Note: make sure to give only the necessary role your users need. In this example I want the user to have read, write and delete access.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac4.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n5. Once you selected it, navigate to the next tab **Members**. Select **User, group, or service principal** and then click on **+ Select members**. On the right side of the screen, type your user or group test and select it from the list.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac5.png?raw=true)\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac6.png?raw=true)\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac7.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n6. Navigate to the next tab **Conditions (optional)** and click on **+ Add condition**.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac8.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n7. You can do it in the Visual or in the Code editor type. For this step we will do it using the Visual editor type. In the **Condition** section, click on **+ Add action**.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac9.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n8. On the right, you will see a screen that has all the actions you can condition. Select **Read blob**. This is the most dangerous action; storage is not compute, which means that a malicious file cannot be invoked in it, so you are not infected. But if a human user or an app reads that file, its game over. This is why we want to restrict this action.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac10.png?raw=true)\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac11.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n9. Now, let's build the expression. Navigate to that section and select **+ Add expression**.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac12.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n10. In **Attribute source** select **Resource**. Then, the **Attribute** we are looking to condition is **Blob index tags [Values in key]**. In the **Key** make sure to copy and paste **Malware scanning scan result**, this is a caps sensitive. In the **Operator** the **value** should be **StringEqualsIgnoreCase**. And finally, the value should be **No threats found** which is also caps sensitive.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac13.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n11. Before you save this, you can scroll up and select the **Code** editor type so that next time you want to implement this specific expression, you can do it in a faster way. In the code you can see that the user/group will be able to do blob listing but not read it, unless the condition 'No threats found' is fulfilled.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac14.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n12. The generated code is the following:\r\n\r\n    ```KQL\r\n    (\r\n        (\r\n            !(ActionMatches{'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read'} AND NOT SubOperationMatches{'Blob.List'})\r\n        )\r\n        OR \r\n        (\r\n            @Resource[Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/tags:Malware scanning scan result<$key_case_sensitive$>] StringEqualsIgnoreCase 'No threats found'\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n13. Click **Save** and then click twice in **Review + assign**.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac15.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n14. Wait for a little until this change applies.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac16.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n15. To test this out, go to your Storage Account container to upload an EICAR file like in the exercise 5.\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac17.png?raw=true)\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac18.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n16. Once you upload it and refresh the screen (click on the refresh icon in the Azure portal), you will see a result like this:\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac19.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n17. If the result was not the one like in the image, you will probably need to navigate to your Storage Account and then click on **Configuration**. As a best practice and for this exercise to work, you have to disable SAS keys and only enable **Default to Azure Active Directory authorization in the Azure portal**. The settings would look like this:\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac20.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n18. Then, in your **Storage Account container** you would have to change your authentication method to **Azure AD User Account** Active Directory\r\n![ABAC](../Images/abac21.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## üéÆ Exercise 12: Test On-demand Malware Scanning\r\n\r\n### Enablement\r\n>\r\n> ***NOTE:***  To enable On-demand Malware Scanning, it is a prerequisite to have On-Upload Malware Scanning ON.\r\n\r\n1.

It also displays the total estimated cost of running the scan across all of those blobs.\r\n\r\n1. If you enabled this in a storage account that already has blobs, click the button **Scan blobs for malware**\r\n![scanblobs](../Images/scanblobs.png)\r\n\r\n2. Once you click it, the scanning status will appear\r\n![scaninprogress](../Images/scaninprogress.png)\r\n\r\n> ***NOTE:***  Scan cancellation is possible before the scan is in \"Waiting for completion\" state.\r\n![cancel](../Images/cancel.png)\r\n\r\n### Testing it via API\r\n\r\n[Download](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Files/On_Demand_Insomnia_2024-10-14.yaml) our Insomnia collection that has the following APIs:\r\n\r\n- Get Scan\r\n- Start Scan\r\n- Cancel Scan\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [Download](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Files/On_Demand_Insomnia_2024-10-14.yaml) API collection\r\n- Install Insomnia\r\n- Import the downloaded template\r\n- Have your Azure Bearer Token for the subscription where you want to use On-demand malware scanning\r\n\r\n#### Get Bearer Token\r\n\r\n1.

Sign in to the **Azure portal**.\n2. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, then **Environment settings**.\n3. Select the relevant subscription.\n4. Toggle the **Defender CSPM** or **Storage** plan to **On**.\n\n   ![Enable DCSPM or Storage plan](../Images/daspenableplan.png?raw=true)\n\n   Detailed permissions to run sensitive data discovery are described in our [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-data-security-posture-prepare#whats-supported).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you have only Storage plan enabled, sensitive data discovery will only be available for resources supported by this plan. If you enable Defender CSPM plan, all supported resources will be included in the scanning, including databases and multicloud resources.\n\n5. Click on **Settings & monitoring** on top of the page.\n6. In the **Sensitive data discovery** component, make sure the toggle is **ON**.\n\n   ![Enable sensitive data discovery](../Images/daspenablediscovery.png?raw=true)\n\n8. Select **Continue** and in the next screen **Save**.\n\n> [!Important]\n> It takes up to 24 hours to see the results for a first-time discovery after enabling the plan. Following scans are done on a weekly basis. If you have enabled any of these plans in previous Modules, allow at least 8 days for the scan to finish its discovery. Alternatively you can add a new Storage account to your subscription. A new Azure storage account that's added to an already discovered subscription is discovered within 24 hours or less.\n\n## (Optional) Exercise 2: Enabling sensitive data discovery for AWS and GCP\n\n### AWS integration\n\nIf you want to use sensitive data discovery for AWS S3 Buckets and RDS databases, visit [**Module 11 - Connecting an AWS project**](Module-11-AWS). Even if you have already done this step, you may have to redeploy the connection scripts with updated permissions.\n\n1. Enable sensitive data discovery as described in **Excercise 1**.\n\n2. Proceed with the instructions to download the CloudFormation template and to run it in AWS.\n\nThe snapshot is used to create a live instance that is spun up, scanned and then immediately destroyed (together with the copied snapshot).\n\nOnly scan findings are reported by the scanning platform.\n\n### GCP integration\n\nIn case of GCP storage buckets, please visit [**Module 10 - Connecting a GCP project**](Module-10-GCP).\n\n1. Enable sensitive data discovery as described in **Excercise 1**.\n\n2. Proceed with the instructions to use GCP Cloud Shell or Terraform to connect GCP resources.\n\n<br>\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> It takes up to 48 hours for first scan results in case of AWS and GCP.\n\n# Data Sensitivity Settings\n\n## Exercise 3: Configure sensitive data categories\n\n1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings**.\n\n3. Select **Data sensitivity** on top of the page.\n\n   ![Edit data sensitivity settings](../Images/daspsensitivitysettings1.png?raw=true)\n\n4. Select the info types category **Other**:\n\n   ![Select info type category Other](../Images/daspsensitivitysettings2.png?raw=true)\n\n5. By default, info types in the **Other** category are excluded from sensitive data discovery. For purposes of this exercise, select **All** and then **Apply**.\n\n   ![Select all info types in category Other](../Images/daspsensitivitysettings3.png?raw=true)\n\n6. Select **Save** on top of the Data sensitivity page to confirm new settings.\n\n## (Optional) Exercise 4: Import and configure custom sensitive info types and sensitivity labels\n\nDefender for Cloud provides built-in sensitive info types (SITs) from Microsoft Purview out-of-the-box. If you have Enterprise Mobility and Security E5/A5/G5 licensing you can also optionally import your own custom sensitive info types and labels from Microsoft Purview compliance portal. After enabling integration with Microsoft Purview, you will get the option to set-up label thresholds and select your custom SITs to be used for sensitive data discovery.\n\n### Enable integration with Microsoft Purview\n\n1. Log into **Microsoft Purview compliance portal**.\n2. Navigate to **Information Protection > Labels**.\n3. In the consent notice messages, select **Turn on** and then select **Yes** to share your custom info types and sensitivity labels with Defender for Cloud.\n\n   ![Enable Purview integration 1](../Images/turnonpurviewintegration1.png?raw=true)\n\n   ![Enable Purview integration 2](../Images/turnonpurviewintegration2.png?raw=true)\n\n<!--\n> [!NOTE]\n> Purview portal integration messages are subject to changes, so it is possible they will not look exactly the same like in this excercise.\n-->\n\n### Create a custom sensitive info type\n\n1. Navigate to **Data classification > Classifiers > Sensitive info types**.\n    - In case of the new Microsoft Purview portal, this can be found in the **Information Protection** blade.\n\n      ![Custom SIT creation 1](../Images/customsit1.png?raw=true)\n\n2. Select **Create sensitive info type**.\n3. Enter name and description.\n\n   ![Custom SIT creation 2](../Images/customsit2.png?raw=true)\n\n4. On the **Patterns** step, select **Create pattern**.\n5. Add primary element and choose **Keyword list**.\n\n   ![Custom SIT creation 3](../Images/customsit3.png?raw=true)\n\n6. In the **ID** field, type  *\"DSPM\"*.\n7. In the **Keyword group #1, Case insensitive**, type *\"data security posture management\"*.\n8. Select the **String match** option and click **Done**.\n\n   ![Custom SIT creation 4](../Images/customsit4.png?raw=true)\n\n9. Confirm by selecting the **Create** button.\n10. Leave **High confidence level** selected in the next step.\n11. On the Finish page review the settings and save the new Custom SIT by selecting the **Create** button.\n\n    ![Custom SIT creation 5](../Images/customsit5.png?raw=true)\n\nYou can now select your Custom SIT from the **Custom** category in the **Data sensitivity** settings described in **Excercise 3**. Create and upload a document which will include the phrase *\"data security posture management\"* to test your Custom SIT.\n\n### Set the threshold for sensitivity labels\n\n In the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, make sure your sensitivity label scope is set to *Items*; under which you should configure auto labeling for *Files* and *Emails*. Labels must be published with a label policy to take effect.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you don't have any existing sensitivity labels, follow [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/how-to-automatically-label-your-content) for instruction on how to create them.\n\n You can use the previously created Custom SIT to be used as auto-labeling condition. If you then create a document with the key phrase, the document will then be automatically labeled. Alternatively, you can manualy label documents for example in Office applications.\n\n ![Auto-labeling](../Images/autolabeling.png?raw=true)\n\nTo have your labeled data visible in Defender for Cloud, follow these steps to check that your labels are included in the sensitive data discovery:\n\n1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Environment settings > Data sensitivity** as described in **Exercise 3**.\n\n2. Select **Change** to see the list of sensitivity labels and select the sensitivity label that will serve as your threshold. If you select the **(Lowest sensitivity)** label, all discovered labeled resources will be shown in Defender for Cloud.\n\n   ![Setting label threshold](../Images/labelthreshold.png?raw=true)\n\n3. Select **Apply** and **Save**.  \n\n# Exercise 5: Upload sensitive data\n\n### Upload data to Storage account\n\nCreate a new storage account based on the instructions in [Module 19](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Modules/Module%2019%20-%20Defender%20for%20Storage.md#exercise-2-create-a-storage-account).\n\n1. In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to **Storage accounts**.\n2. Open the storage account you have created.\n3. Navigate to **Data storage > Containers** and create new container by selecting the **+ Container** button on top of the page.\n\n   ![Create Container](../Images/createcontainerdasp.png?raw=true)\n\n4. Choose a name, leave other settings by default and select **Create**.\n5. Open the new container by clicking on its name and select the **Upload** button on top of the page.\n6. Navigate to [Files](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Files/TestData.zip) and download the *TestData.zip* file. This is a file that contains sample of sensitive data we will use in this exercise.\n7. Select the file *\"Credit Card Expenses.docx\"* located in *CreditCardNumber* folder from the extracted zip archive and upload it to the container.\n\n   ![Upload data to Container](../Images/uploaddatatocontainerdasp.png?raw=true)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> It takes up to 24 hours for first scan results in case of newly created storage account. Databases are scanned on a weekly basis or within 24 hours on newly enabled subscriptions.\n\n### (Optional) Upload data to Azure SQL database\n\nIn [Module 1](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Modules/Module-1-Preparing-the-Environment.md), you created an Azure SQL database, *asclab-db*. In this exercise, we will connect to the database and upload sensitive information.\n\n1. Follow instructions [on this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/import-export/import-data-from-excel-to-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) to upload the .xlsx file into the database created as part of **Module 1**. We recommend to use Microsoft SQL Management Studio for the import (SMSS) with the following steps.\n2. In SMSS, select the **asclab-db** database and choose **Import Data** via **Tasks**.\n\n   ![SMSS import data 1](../Images/smssimportdata1.png?raw=true)\n\n3.

Confirm and finish the Wizard.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> As described in **Exercise 1** you will now have to wait for the specified time, depending on when you have enabled the plans or created the resources, to allow the scan to finish. Follow [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-data-security-posture-prepare#discovery) to our documentation for more details.\n\n# Explore risks to sensitive data\n\nAfter you discover resources with sensitive data, Microsoft Defender for Cloud lets you explore sensitive data risk for those resources in several ways. We will have a look at the following options:\n\n- **Security Explorer**: You can use Cloud Security Explorer to find sensitive data insights.\n- **Attack Paths**: You can use attack paths to discover risk of data breaches.\n- **Security alerts**: You can prioritize and explore ongoing threats to sensitive data stores by applying sensitivity filters Security Alerts settings.\n- **Inventory**: You will get enhanced context in the Inventory for supported resources.\n- **Data security dashboard**: Data-centric security dashboard helps effectively prioritize alerts and potential attack paths for data across multicloud data resources.\n\n## Exercise 6: Explore risks with Cloud Security Explorer\n\nExplore data risks and exposure in cloud security graph insights using a query template, or by defining a manual query.\n\n1. In Defender for Cloud, open **Cloud Security Explorer**.\n\n2. In the Query builder, from the **Select resource types** drop down menu, select *Data > Object storage > **Azure Storage accounts*** and click **Done**.\n\n   ![Security explorer query 1](../Images/daspsecurityexplorer1.png?raw=true)\n\n3. Add condition by selecting the **+** button. Choose *Data > **Contains sensitive data***\n\n   ![Security explorer query 2](../Images/daspsecurityexplorer2.png?raw=true)\n\n4. Run the query by clicking on the **Search** button.\n\n   ![Security explorer query 3](../Images/daspsecurityexplorer3.png?raw=true)\n\n5. In the *Results* section, look for the Storage account you've created in previous exercise and where you uploaded the *Credit Card Expenses.docx* file. After selecting it, *Result details* window will pop-up in the side, where you can review details. Select the **Export** button to export finding details to a csv file.\n\n   ![Security explorer query 4](../Images/daspsecurityexplorer4.png?raw=true)\n\n4. After opening the exported csv file, you can identify the specific files in which Defender for Cloud identified sensitive content and what sensitive info types did it match.\n\n   ![Security explorer query 5](../Images/daspsecurityexplorer5.png?raw=true)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Sensitive data discovery in Defender for Cloud uses smart sampling scanning to achieve high efficiency of scanning and does not provide by design, an exhaustive list of all files in the scanned resource.\n\n## Exercise 7: Identify sensitive resources in Inventory\n\n1. In Defender for Cloud, open **Inventory**.\n2. Add a filter **Sensitive info types** to narrow down the list.\n\n   ![Inventory sensitive data 1](../Images/daspinventory1.png?raw=true)\n\n3. In the **Value** drop-down list, uncheck ***(Unclassified)*** to show only resources containing sensitive info types and confirm by selecting **OK**.\n\n   ![Inventory sensitive data 2](../Images/daspinventory2.png?raw=true)\n\n4. Click on the name of the Storage account where you have uploaded sensitive data sample in previous exercise.\n\n   ![Inventory sensitive data 3](../Images/daspinventory3.png?raw=true)\n\n5. On the *Resource health overview*, you can review the *Sensitive info types* in the **Security value** section.\n\n   ![Inventory sensitive data 4](../Images/daspinventory4.png?raw=true)\n\n## (Optional) Exercise 8: Explore risks through attack paths\n\n1. In Defender for Cloud, open **Attack path analysis**.\n\n2. In **Risk Factors**, select **Sensitive data** to filter the data-related attack paths.\n\n   ![Attack Path risk factors](../Images/daspattackpaths1.png?raw=true)\n\n3. Review the attack paths.\n\n4. To view sensitive information detected in data resources, select the resource name and then **Insights**. There is a section **Insights - Contains sensitive data**, where you can investigate details of the sensitive data discovery.\n\n   ![Attack Path insights](../Images/daspattackpaths2.png?raw=true)\n\n## (Optional) Exercise 9: Explore sensitive data security alerts\n\nWhen sensitive data discovery is enabled in the Defender for Storage plan, you can prioritize alerts that affect resources with sensitive data.\n\n1. In Defender for Cloud, open **Security alerts**.\n2. Click on **Add filter** and search for **Sensitive info types**. In the **Value** parameter, uncheck **(Unclassified)** and confirm the filter by selecting **OK**.\n\n   ![Alerts SIT 1](../Images/daspalerts1.png?raw=true)\n\n3. After selecting one of the alerts, you can identify the sensitive info types by scrolling down in the details window.\n\n   ![Alerts SIT 2](../Images/daspalerts2.png?raw=true)\n\n## (Optional) Exercise 10: Data security dashboard investigation\n\n1. In Defender for Cloud, open **Data security**.\nCheck the following tiles and look for unusual data:\n\n    ![Data security dashboard 1](../Images/datasecuritydashboard1.png?raw=true)\n\n- **Data resources requiring attention** - displays the number of sensitive resources that have either high severity security alerts or attack paths. Click on **high severity alerts** or **attack paths** to further drill down on the findings.\n  - **Data resources with high severity alerts** - summarizes the active threats to sensitive data resources and which data types are at risk.\n\n     ![Data security dashboard 2](../Images/datasecuritydashboard2.png?raw=true)\n\n  - **Data resources with critical and high attack paths** - summarizes the potential threats to sensitive data resources by presenting attack paths leading to sensitive data resources and which data types are at potential risk.\n\n     ![Data security dashboard 3](../Images/datasecuritydashboard3.png?raw=true)\n\n- **Data queries in security explorer** - presents the top data-related queries in security explorer that helps focus on multicloud risks to sensitive data. Click on **View** to narrow down the specific query.\n\n   ![Data security dashboard 4](../Images/datasecuritydashboard4.png?raw=true)\n\n- **Sensitive data discovery** - summarizes the results of the sensitive resources discovered, allowing you to explore a specific sensitive information type and label. You can also open the data sensitivity settings described in **Exercise 3** by using the **Manage data sensitivity settings** button.\n\n   ![Data security dashboard 5](../Images/datasecuritydashboard5.png?raw=true)\n\n- **Internet-exposed data resources** - summarizes the discovery of sensitive data resources that are internet-exposed for storage and managed databases. Click on **View all data resources exposed to the internet** to run a query in Cloud security explorer.\n\n   ![Data security dashboard 6](../Images/datasecuritydashboard6.png?raw=true)\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:29.418304"}

Ensure Microsoft Defender for Containers is enabled in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n2. Check that the Defender sensor is installed in the AKS cluster by running:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get ds microsoft-defender-collector-ds -n kube-system\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\nNAME                             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE\nmicrosoft-defender-collector-ds 1         1         1       1            1           <none>          Xh\n```\n\n> **Notes**: If the microsoft-defender-collector-ds daemonset is missing or not running, confirm that Defender for Containers is enabled in Environment Settings > Azure Kubernetes Service in Defender for Cloud.\n\n### 3.3 Run the Simulation Script\n\nExecute the simulation.py script to run individual or combined attack scenarios:\n\n```bash\npython3 simulation.py\n```\n\nSelect an attack scenario from the menu or choose the option to simulate all scenarios.\n\n### Available Simulated Scenarios and Expected Alerts\n\n| Scenario | Expected Alerts |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| Reconnaissance | - Possible Web Shell activity detected<br>- Suspicious Kubernetes service account operation detected<br>- Network scanning tool detected |\n| Lateral Movement | - Possible Web Shell activity detected<br>- Access to cloud metadata service detected |\n| Secrets Gathering | - Possible Web Shell activity detected<br>- Sensitive files access detected<br>- Possible secret reconnaissance detected |\n| Cryptomining | - Possible Web Shell activity detected<br>- Kubernetes CPU optimization detected<br>- Command within a container accessed ld.so.preload<br>- Possible Crypto miners download detected<br>- A drift binary detected executing in the container |\n| Web Shell | - Possible Web Shell activity detected |\n\n### Validation\n\nAfter selecting a scenario, check the logs of the attacker pod (run this command from another shell terminal):\n\n```bash\nkubectl logs mdc-simulation-attacker -n mdc-simulation\n```\n\n1. Verify that the attack simulation executed successfully.\n2. Navigate to Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Security Alerts in the Azure portal to view the generated alerts.\n\n> **Notes**: If the simulation fails, check the attacker pod logs for errors:\n> ```bash\n> kubectl logs mdc-simulation-attacker -n mdc-simulation\n> ```\n\n> **Final Note**: The script is designed to simulate realistic container threats in a controlled environment. Ensure you do not run these simulations on production systems. At the end of the simulation you will be prompted to '**Run another scenario? (Y/N)**'. \n\n> ![Mod 25 Security Alerts](../Images/mod.25.simulation.end.png?raw=true)\n\n> Depending on which scenario you have executed, you might run additional ones. It is reccommended to run all for a full end-to-end lab experience. Once done you can select '**N**' to complete the simulation script. The script is designed to delete the 2 images/pods and related Namespace once done. If you wish to interact with the images/pods as they are running, it is recommended to not terminate the script (perhaps if you decide to test remediation actions).\n\n## Azure Defender Cloud Security Alert Analysis Guide\n\n### Step 4: Observing and Analyzing MDC Alerts\n\n### 4.1 Review Security Alerts\n\n1. Navigate to Microsoft Defender for Cloud > Security Alerts in the Azure portal.\n\n2. Review the alerts generated from the attack simulation:\n   - Example alerts include:\n     * \"Cryptocurrency mining container detected\"\n     * \"Suspicious Kubernetes API access\"\n     * \"Sensitive data accessed\"\n   - Alerts will indicate which specific resources (e.g., attacker/victim pods) were affected.\n\n3. Use the search bar to filter alerts by cluster name or affected resources for easier identification. You should see a list of Alerts as per the image below.\n\n![Mod 25 Security Alerts](../Images/mod.25.sec.alerts.png?raw=true)\n\n### 4.2 Analyze Alert Details\n\n1. Click on an alert to open its details pane.\n\n2. Review the following information:\n   - **Description**: Provides an overview of the detected threat and its potential impact.\n   - **Severity**: Indicates how critical the alert is (High, Medium, or Low).\n   - **Affected Resources**: Lists resources impacted by the threat (e.g., Kubernetes pods or nodes).\n   - **Suggested Remediation Steps**: Offers actionable guidance to address the threat, such as patching or isolating the resource.\n\n### Validation\n\n- Ensure each attack scenario generates the expected alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n- Use the table from Step 3.3 to cross-check the alerts for each scenario.\n\n### Troubleshooting Tip\n\nIf no alerts are generated:\n- Verify that the Defender sensor is installed and running:\n  ```bash\n  kubectl get ds microsoft-defender-collector-ds -n kube-system\n  ```\n- Confirm the AKS cluster is properly protected in MDC under Environment Settings > Azure Kubernetes Service.\n\n### Step 5: Correlating and Responding to Incidents Using XDR\n\n### 5.1 Correlate Alerts in Microsoft 365 Defender\n\n1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 Defender > Incidents & Alerts in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.\n\n2. Search for incidents or alerts corresponding to the container-based threats detected by MDC:\n   - Look for incidents related to:\n     * Cryptomining activity\n     * Web shell activity\n     * Kubernetes metadata access\n\n![Mod 25 Security Alerts](../Images/mod.25.xdr.inc.png?raw=true)\n\n3. Click on an incident to view its details, including:\n   - **Correlated Alerts**: Shows how the alert relates to others across telemetry sources (e.g., MDC, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Identity).\n   - **Incident Description**: Provides an overview of the attack chain.\n\n![Mod 25 Security Alerts](../Images/mod.25.xdr.inc.2.png?raw=true)\n\n### 5.2 Investigate the Incident\n\n1. Open the incident and review the following:\n   - **Attack Timeline**: Displays the sequence of events that occurred during the attack simulation.\n   - **Affected Entities**: Lists impacted resources, such as specific containers, pods, or endpoints.\n   - **Threat Context**: Explains how this threat correlates with other alerts (e.g., combining MDC's Kubernetes telemetry with Defender for Endpoint's runtime behavior analysis).\n\n2. Use the available investigation tools in Microsoft 365 Defender:\n   - **Advanced Hunting**: Run queries to dig deeper into specific events or behaviors associated with the incident.\n   - **Automated Investigation**: Review automated investigation results to identify suspicious behaviors and root causes.\n\n### 5.3 Take Response Actions\n\n1. From the incident details, perform response actions directly in the XDR interface:\n   - **Isolate the Affected Container**:\n     Slect the affected container and click '**Actions**', then you can select to isolate or terminate the Pod. \n     ![Mod 25 Security Alerts](../Images/mod.25.xdr.actions.png?raw=true)\n\n     Alternatively, you can do it manually by scale it down or cordon the affected Kubernetes nodes:\n     ```bash\n     kubectl cordon <node-name>\n     kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data\n     ```\n\n   - **Disable Compromised Credentials**:\n     If sensitive files were accessed (e.g., .git-credentials), revoke the associated credentials immediately.\n\n   - **Block Malicious IPs**:\n     Add suspicious IPs detected in MDC to the firewall or network security group (NSG) deny list.\n\n2. Monitor the incident resolution status in Microsoft 365 Defender.\n\n### Final Notes\n\n- **Near Real-Time Alerts**:\n  - Some alerts, such as Web Shell activity, are generated in near real-time.\n  - Others, like cryptomining, may take up to an hour to appear in Defender for Cloud.\n\n### Validation\n\n- Verify that incidents generated in Microsoft 365 Defender correlate correctly with alerts from MDC.\n- Ensure response actions (e.g., isolation, blocking) are successfully executed.\n\n\n## **Introduction to Advanced Hunting**\n\nIn this section, we dive into **Advanced Hunting** using **KQL (Kusto Query Language)** to gain deeper insights into the simulated attack scenarios executed in the lab. By leveraging advanced hunting capabilities, we can effectively trace attacker actions, correlate them with victim activities, and generate a comprehensive timeline of events.\n\nThis approach is particularly useful for:\n\n1. **Forensic Analysis**:\n   - Understanding the techniques used by the attacker (e.g., reconnaissance, lateral movement, cryptomining).\n   - Identifying how the victim environment responds to those attacks.\n\n2. **Incident Correlation**:\n   - Linking attacker activities (e.g., `curl` commands targeting the webshell) with the processes spawned on the victim pod (`php-fpm`).\n   - Tracing the full attack chain across the Kubernetes environment.\n\n3. **Threat Validation**:\n   - Validating the security alerts generated by Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) and their alignment with observed activity.\n   - Highlighting gaps, if any, in detection mechanisms.\n\n### **Key Focus Areas**\n\n1. **Attacker Behavior Analysis**:\n   - Investigating the attack techniques initiated by the `attacker` pod, including the use of tools like `curl`, `nmap`, and `xmrig`, as well as attempts to access sensitive data.\n\n2. **Victim Activity Monitoring**:\n   - Tracking suspicious processes executed on the `victim` pod, such as commands spawned by `php-fpm` via the webshell or attempts to access Kubernetes secrets.\n\n3. **Correlation of Events**:\n   - Joining attacker and victim activities to establish a clear link between malicious inputs and their outcomes, ensuring a holistic understanding of the attack simulation.\n\n### **Why Advanced Hunting Matters**\n\nAdvanced hunting allows security teams to move beyond predefined alerts and explore raw telemetry data. This capability is critical for:\n- Uncovering subtle attack patterns.\n- Correlating cross-source data for enriched context.\n- Generating actionable insights to improve detection and response mechanisms.\n\nIn the following queries, you‚Äôll learn how to:\n1. Analyze specific attack actions from the `attacker` pod.\n2. Monitor the response and suspicious processes on the `victim` pod.\n3. Correlate attacker and victim activities into a unified timeline for actionable reporting.\n\nLet‚Äôs start by examining attacker actions and move toward comprehensive correlation between attacker and victim activities.\n\n\n## Detailed Queries\n### Query Usage Guidance\n1. **Attacker-Centric Query**: \n   - Perform initial forensic analysis of attacker techniques.\n\n2. **Victim-Centric Query**: \n   - Understand the victim's response and identify compromised resources.\n\n3. **Correlation Query**: \n   - Generate an attack timeline to understand end-to-end activity.\n\n### 1. Attacker-Centric Query - Identify Attacker Actions\n\nThe first step in advanced hunting is to analyze the behavior of the attacker pod in the Kubernetes environment. This involves identifying processes, tools, and commands executed as part of the simulated attack scenarios. By focusing on the attacker pod, we gain visibility into the techniques and tools used during reconnaissance, lateral movement, secrets gathering, and cryptomining activities.\n\n**Objective**: Trace all actions initiated by the attacker pod (attacker). Use the following query to identify all relevant commands executed within the attacker pod, such as curl, nmap, xmrig, and attempts to access sensitive files.\n\n**What This Query Does:**\n\nFilters events for the namespace `mdc-simulation` and the pod containing \"attacker.\"\nIdentifies processes executed by the attacker pod that are relevant to the simulated scenarios:\n* `curl`: Used for webshell invocation (e.g., HTTP requests to `ws.php`).\n* `nmap`: Used for network reconnaissance.\n* `xmrig`: A cryptomining binary.\n* `.git-credentials`: Indicates attempts to gather secrets.\n* `cmd=`: Signals possible command injection.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nA list of processes executed in the attacker pod, including their timestamps, commands, and process names.\n\n```kusto\nCloudProcessEvents\n| where KubernetesNamespace == \"mdc-simulation\" and KubernetesPodName contains \"attacker\"\n| where ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"curl\", \"nmap\", \"xmrig\", \"cmd=\", \".git-credentials\")\n| project Timestamp, ProcessName, ProcessCommandLine, KubernetesNamespace, KubernetesPodName, AccountName\n| order by Timestamp desc\n```\n\n**Usage**:\n- Use this to identify all attack attempts and techniques initiated by the attacker pod.\n- Provides a focused view on attack behavior for forensic analysis.\n\n### 2. Victim-Centric Query - Monitoring Victim Activity\n\nThe next step is to analyze the behavior on the victim pod, focusing on suspicious activity such as commands executed via the webshell, attempts to access Kubernetes secrets, or modification of critical files. By monitoring the php-fpm process (the parent of webshell commands), we can attribute victim-side activity directly to the attacker's inputs.\n\n**Objective**: Monitor suspicious activity in the victim pod (victim), particularly those executed by php-fpm.\n\n**What This Query Does:**\n\nFilters events for the namespace `mdc-simulation` and the pod containing \"victim.\"\nFocuses on:\n* Processes spawned by the php-fpm parent process (webshell activity).\n* Commands likely linked to secrets access or privilege escalation.\n* Sensitive file modifications (e.g., Kubernetes tokens or preload files).\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nA list of suspicious processes and file access activities on the victim pod.\n\n```kusto\nCloudProcessEvents\n| where KubernetesNamespace == \"mdc-simulation\" and KubernetesPodName contains \"victim\"\n| where ParentProcessName == \"php-fpm\"\n   or ProcessCommandLine has_any (\"cmd=\", \".git-credentials\", \"nmap\", \"xmrig\", \"curl\", \"sudo\", \"chmod\", \"setcap\")\n   or FileName has_any (\"/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token\", \"/etc/ld.so.preload\")\n   or ActionType == \"FileModified\"\n| project Timestamp, ProcessName, ProcessCommandLine, ParentProcessName, FileName, FolderPath, KubernetesNamespace, KubernetesPodName, AccountName\n| order by Timestamp desc\n```\n\n**Usage**:\n- Focuses on activities within the victim pod, identifying processes spawned by php-fpm or accessing sensitive files.\n- Provides insight into how the victim reacts to the attacker's actions.\n\n### 4. Correlation Query for Attacker and Victim Activities\nTo establish a unified view of the attack, correlate the actions performed by the attacker pod (e.g., curl to ws.php) with processes executed on the victim pod (e.g., commands spawned by php-fpm).\n\n**Objective**: Link attacker curl commands with victim php-fpm processes.\n\n**What This Query Does:**\n\nThis query correlates attacker commands (curl requests) with victim-side activity (processes spawned by php-fpm) in the mdc-simulation namespace, enabling you to establish a clear relationship between the attacker's actions and their impact on the victim pod.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nThe output provides a correlated view of the attacker's curl requests (targeting the victim webshell) and the processes executed on the victim pod as a result of those requests.\n\n```kusto\nlet AttackerActions = CloudProcessEvents\n| where KubernetesNamespace == \"mdc-simulation\" and KubernetesPodName contains \"attacker\"\n| where ProcessCommandLine has \"curl\" and ProcessCommandLine has \"ws.php\"\n| project AttackerTimestamp = Timestamp, AttackerCommandLine = ProcessCommandLine, TargetURL = extract(\"http[s]?://([^/]+)\", 1, ProcessCommandLine), KubernetesNamespace, KubernetesPodName;\n\nlet VictimObservations = CloudProcessEvents\n| where KubernetesNamespace == \"mdc-simulation\" and KubernetesPodName contains \"victim\"\n| where ParentProcessName == \"php-fpm\"\n| project VictimTimestamp = Timestamp, VictimCommandLine = ProcessCommandLine, VictimPodName = KubernetesPodName, VictimParentProcess = ParentProcessName, KubernetesNamespace;\n\nAttackerActions\n| join kind=inner (VictimObservations) on KubernetesNamespace\n| where TargetURL contains VictimPodName\n| order by AttackerTimestamp desc\n```\n\n**Usage**:\n- Best suited for correlating curl requests with PHP webshell commands in attack simulations.\n- Demonstrates attacker-victim interaction and validates the simulation flow.\n\n## Context and Recommendations\n\n### Why Use php-fpm as a Focal Point?\n- Since all commands executed via the webshell originate from php-fpm, it's critical for tracing attacker-victim interactions.\n- This parent-child process relationship allows attribution of malicious activity to specific attacker commands.\n\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:29.912416"}

Clone [this repository](https://github.com/laragoldstein13/ReachabilityDemo/tree/master) in Azure DevOps.\n2. Create a service connection in Azure DevOps to Docker. Select 'Other' when you have to specify the type of connection. Here you must specify the container registry login server, username, and password that come from access keys in Azure Container Registry. \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1535e01-9d22-4df8-8bf0-e83cf070ba34)\n3. Create a service connection in Azure DevOps to Azure Resource Manager. Ensure that you give the service connection permissions to the relevant subscription and resource group that hosts your Kubernetes cluster. \n4. Create a variable group in Azure Pipelines called 'tenant-variables'. This is where you should store your ENDOR_API_CREDENTIALS_KEY, ENDOR_API_SECRET, and NAMESPACE information that you get from Endor Labs. For more guidance, see [Endor Labs documentation](https://docs.endorlabs.com/deployment/ci-scans/scan-with-azuredevops/).\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57d10b39-4af0-43a3-af16-9359e287bc48)\n5. Create a new pipeline using the existing file located at [AzurePipeline/azure-pipelines.yml](https://github.com/laragoldstein13/ReachabilityDemo/blob/master/AzurePipeline/azure-pipelines.yml).\n6. Add the following variables to the pipeline: clusterName (name of the Kubernetes cluster to deploy the container on), containerRegistry (login server name for the Azure Container Registry, e.g., reachability.azurecr.io), dockerConnection (name of the service connection to Docker to push image to Azure Container Registry), resourceGroup (resource group that hosts the Kubernetes cluster), and subscription (name of the service connection name to Azure Resource Manager).\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd265dee-fbc5-4933-8b12-07e7ff76fefc)\n7. Save and run the pipeline.\n   \n# Exercise 2: GitHub Configuration\n1. Clone [this repository]([this repository](https://github.com/laragoldstein13/ReachabilityDemo/tree/master)) in GitHub.\n2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions in the GitHub repository.\n4. Create secrets for your ACR_USERNAME and ACR_PASSWORD. These come from Access Keys in ACR.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc263e0c-b031-4a0d-acfb-7ea10719c634)\n5. Create a variable for the ACR login server name (e.g., reachability.azurecr.io).\n6. Configure [authentication](https://docs.endorlabs.com/deployment/ci-scans/scan-with-github-actions/) from GitHub to Endor Labs to send results \n7. Create a new workflow using the existing file located at [.github/workflows/containermapping.yml](https://github.com/laragoldstein13/ReachabilityDemo/blob/master/.github/workflows/containermapping.yml).\n8. Save and run the workflow.\n9. Deploy the container image from ACR to your AKS cluster in the Azure Portal. The easiest way to do this is to navigate to the AKS cluster and select Create > Create a quickstar application. Note that your registry and Kubernetes cluser must be [linked](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-container-registry-integration?tabs=azure-cli#configure-acr-integration-for-an-existing-aks-cluster) for this to work. To see the attack path, the container should be exposed via a service in Kubernetes. It is not recommended to do this in production tenants. \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74bb2699-1e89-4f34-9140-03bba0b75fae)\n \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis container image is highly insecure, and as such, should not be deployed on internet facing servers in production environments.

Open an **In-Private** session in your web browser and navigate to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free\n2. On the main part of this page, click **Start free** and use your Microsoft Account credentials to you to login to Azure Portal.\nImportant - Make sure you are not logged in with your corporate user.\n3. Type your Microsoft Account email address and then click on **Next**.\n4. On the **Stay signed in** message, click **Yes**.\n5. At the **Try Azure for free** page, type in your details following the 4-steps (your profile, identity verification by phone, identity verification by card, agreement). Once you complete all steps, click on **Sign Up** button to complete the subscription creation process.\n6. On the **You‚Äôre ready to start with Azure** page, click on **Go to portal** button. Now you should have Azure Subscription named **Azure subscription 1** including owner permissions.\n\n### Exercise 2: Provisioning resources\n\n> ‚ùó Important: <br>\n> You should also be accessing the Microsoft Defender for Cloud labs in the same private window. Otherwise, link from the lab will be open on a non-private window. \n\nAs part of the exercises mentioned in this lab guide, you will create an environment using an automated deployment based on ARM template.\nAn ARM template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it.\nThe following list of resources will be deployed during the provisioning process (including dependencies like disks, network interfaces, public IP addresses, etc.):\n\nName | Resource Type | Purpose\n-----| ------------- | -------\nasclab-win | Virtual machine | Windows Server\nasclab-linux | Virtual machine | Linux Server\nasclab-as | Availability set | Availability set for the 2-VMs\nasclab-aks | Kubernetes service | Testing container services capabilities\nasclab-app-[uniqestring] | App Service | App service to be used for web app, function app\nasclab-sql-[uniqestring] | SQL server | To be using for the sample database\nasclab-as | SQL database | Sample database based on AdventureWorks template\nasclab-kv-[uniqestring] | Key vault | Demonstrating Key Vault related recommendations and security alerts\nasclab-fa-[uniqestring] | Function App | Demonstrating related built-in and custom security recommendations\nasclab-la-[uniqestring]\t| Log Analytics workspace | Log Analytics workspace used for data collection and analysis, storing logs and continuous export data\nasclab-nsg | Network security group | Required for Just-in-Time access and security recommendations\nasclab-splan | App Service plan | Demonstrating related security recommendations\nasclab-vnet | Virtual network | Default virtual network for both Azure VM and for network related recommendations\nasclabcr[uniqestring] | Container registry | Demonstrating related security recommendations\nasclabsa[uniqestring] | Storage account | Demonstrating related security recommendations\nSecurityCenterFree | Solution | Default workspace solution used for Microsoft Defender for Cloud free tier\n\nAfter the deployment of the template, you can check the progress of your deployment if you click on your created resource group details, then click on Deployments (1 deploying).\nContinue with the exercise below until the deployment has completed.\n<br><br>\n\n<img src=\"../Images/asc-lab-architecture.svg?raw=true\">\n<br>\n\n1. Prepare your lab environment by clicking on the blue **Deploy to Azure** button below:\n\n<a href=\"https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FAzure-Security-Center%2Fmaster%2FLabs%2FFiles%2Flabdeploy.json\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton\"/></a>\n\n2.\tYou will be redirected to Azure Portal > custom deployment page where you should specify mandatory fields for deployment.\n3.\tOn the subscription field, select **Azure subscription 1**.\n4.\tOn the resource group field, click on **Create new** and name it as **asclab** (you can pick any name you want or keep the default).\n5.\tOn the parameters section, select the closest data center **region** to your current location (all downstream resources will be created in the same region as the resource group).\n6. Select a password that will be used across services (such as credentials for virtual machines and SQL database)\n> ‚ùó Important: <br>\n> Notice that password must be between 12 and 72 characters and have 3 of the following: 1 lower case, 1 upper case, 1 number and 1 special character. Failure to do so will result in deployment failures.  \n7.\tClick **Review + create** to start the validation process. Once validation passed, click on **Create** to start the ARM deployment on your subscription.\n8.\tThe deployment takes about **10 minutes** to complete.<br>\n\n> The *deployment is in progress* page continues to update and show the resources being uploaded to the environment assuming the deployment is successful.  \n> During the deployment, additional resource group will be created automatically for Kubernetes resources named as ‚Äúasclab-aks‚Äù.<br>\n\n<p align=\"left\"><img src=\"../Images/deploy-to-azure.gif?raw=true\"></p>\n\nYou can also check the progress of your deployment if you click on your created resource group details, then click on **Deployments** (*1 deploying*). <br>\n\n![Template deployment is in progress](../Images/asc-deployment-in-progress.gif?raw=true)\n\nWhen the deployment is complete, you should see the following:\n\n![Template deployment completed](../Images/asc-deployment-completed.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Exercise 3: Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud\n\n#### Subscription upgrade and agents installation\n1. Open **Azure Portal** and navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** blade.\n2. Click on **Getting started** page from the left pane, On the **Upgrade** Tab, select subscription (Azure subscription 1) and press **Enable**.\n   >Note: You may need to wait for a few minutes for the upgrade to complete.\n3. Select both **Azure subscription 1**, and also the **workspace name** underneath it. Click on **Upgrade** to upgrade.\n   ![Template deployment completed](../Images/mdfc-gettingstarted.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Get the status of the Defender coverage on the subscription and the workspace\n1. Return to Microsoft Defender for Cloud blade and Click on **Environment settings**. Click the down arrow on **Azure** to show the subscription, and then click the down arrow on **Azure Susbcription 1** to show the workspace. Notice the Defender coverage is 12/12 plans for the subscription.\n> Previously for Defender for Server and Defender for SQL on Machines, it was required to enable the Defender plan on a Log Analytics workspace.  By default, both plans no longer require the use of a Log Analytics workspace (Defender for SQL on Machines will however create one due to DCR requirements).    \n\n2. Click on **Azure subscription 1**, and notice how all Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans are enabled. \n\n> If you need to enable individual plans, first ensure that the Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans blue box on the right hand side is selected, and then you can select the specific Defender plans underneath.\n\n<br>\n\n> Please notice:\n> * Before clicking on the Upgrade button, you can review the total number of resources you are going to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on.\n> * You can enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud trial for 30-days on a subscriptions only if not previously used.\n> * To enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on a subscription, you must be assigned the role of Subscription Owner, Subscription Contributor, or Security Admin.\n\n### Continue with the next lab: [Module 2 - Exploring Microsoft Defender for Cloud](../Modules/Module-2-Exploring-Azure-Security-Center.md)\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:30.129478"}

Note that you need either owner permissions or user access admin and security admin on the subscription to successfully complete this lab.\r\n\r\nSee the [official Agentless Container Posture documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-agentless-containers).\r\n\r\nLearn more about different use cases for container security in Microsoft Defender for cloud: [Container Security in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/container-security-with-microsoft-defender-for-cloud/ba-p/3819956)\r\n\r\nLearn how to enable how to enable agentless container security posture: [One click to cover containers and Kubernetes in Defender CSPM (agentless)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/one-click-to-cover-containers-amp-kubernetes-in-defender-cspm/ba-p/3822435)\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Exercise 1: Prepare your environment.**\r\n\r\nBefore we set up the resources to be used for this lab, we first need to turn on agentless discovery of Kubernetes and agentless container image scanning in Defender CSPM. Note that Defender for Containers also provides agentless container image scanning but does not include attack paths. You can enable agentless container posture in the Defender for Cloud portal by going to Environment Settings. Once you select your Azure Subscription, make sure Defender CSPM is turned on, click monitoring coverage and turn on ‚ÄúAgentless discovery for Kubernetes‚Äù and ‚ÄúContainer registries vulnerability assessments‚Äù.\r\n\r\n![](../Images/enablecontainersdcspm.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nNow that we‚Äôve turned on the features needed from Defender CSPM, we can prepare our resources. \r\n\r\n**1. Attach your Azure Container Registry to an Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster**\r\n \r\n In module one, you deployed an ARM template that included an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster and an Azure Container Registry. Now you need to point your Azure Kubernetes Service instance to pull images from the Azure Container Registry.  Only change the part in <>. \r\n\r\nUse the following ***cloud shell*** command line to point your AKS instance to pull images from the selected ACR [read more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-container-registry-integration?tabs=azure-cli#configure-acr-integration-for-existing-aks-clusters):\r\n\r\n```\r\naz aks update -n <myAKSCluster> -g <your-ResourceGroup> --attach-acr <your-acr-name>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEx: \r\n```\r\naz aks update -n asclab-aks -g labgroup --attach-acr asclabacr123\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWait for the role propagation to finish running. AAD role propagation should show 100% when this step is successfully completed as shown in the image below.\r\n\r\n![](../Images/dcspmrolepropagation.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n**2.\tImport a mock vulnerable image to your Azure Container Registry. Remember to replace the text in <>.**\r\n\r\nRun in cloud shell: \r\n\r\n```\r\naz acr import --name <your-acr-name> --source DCSPMtesting.azurecr.io/mdc-mock-0001 --image mdc-mock-0001 \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**3.\tAllow work on the cluster:**\r\n\r\n```\r\naz aks get-credentials  --subscription <your-subscriptionid> --resource-group <your-rg-name> --name <your-cluster-name>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**4.\tDeploy a mock vulnerable image and expose the vulnerable container to the internet.**\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelm install dcspmcharts  oci://mcr.microsoft.com/mdc/stable/dcspmcharts --version 1.0.0 --namespace mdc-dcspm-demo --create-namespace --set image=<your-acr-name.azurecr.io/mdc-mock-0001> --set distribution=AZURE\r\n```\r\n\r\n**5.\tVerify success of the deployment:**\r\n\r\nVerify success by navigating to your AKS cluster and check for the following:\r\n\r\n- Look for an entry with mdc-dcspm-demo as the namespace\r\n![](../Images/verifynamespacedeployment.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n- In Workloads-> Deployments tab verify ‚Äúpod‚Äù created 3/3 and ‚Äúdcspmcharts-ingress-nginx-controller‚Äù 1/1.\r\n![](../Images/verifycontainersdeployment.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n- In services and ingresses look for-> services ‚Äúservice‚Äù, ‚Äúdcspmcharts-ingress-nginx-controller‚Äù and ‚Äúdcspmcharts-ingress-nginx-controller-admission‚Äù. In the ingress tab you should verify one ‚Äúingress‚Äù is created with an ip address and nginx class.\r\n\r\n![](../Images/verifyservicesdeployment.png?raw=true)\r\n![](../Images/verifyingressdeployment.png?raw=true)\r\n \r\n\r\n**6.\tWaiting period of six hours**\r\n\r\nThe system‚Äôs architecture is based on a snapshotting mechanism with an interval of every 6 hours, which is typically the time to observe inventory. For insights and attack paths it can take up to 24 hours. \r\nFrom there, we can investigate the deployment via the Cloud Security Explorer and Attack paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Exercise 2: Investigate internet exposed Kubernetes pods through the Cloud Security Explorer**\r\n\r\nFrom the Defender for Cloud overview page, open the Cloud Security Explorer (Preview) page. \r\n\r\n![](../Images/opencloudsecurityexplorer.png?raw=true)\r\n \r\nYou‚Äôll notice some out of the box templates for Kubernetes such as the two examples below. Click ‚Äúopen query, then \"search\" to view the results. Both templates should yield results from our environment setup:\r\n\r\n**1.\tAzure Kubernetes pods running images with high severity** vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n![](../Images/queryrunningpods.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n![](../Images/queryrunningpodsresults.png?raw=true)\r\n \r\n**2.\tKubernetes namespaces contain vulnerable pods.**\r\n\r\n ![](../Images/vulnerablenamespace.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n ![](../Images/vulnerablenamespaceresults.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n \r\nYou can also create your own queries. For this example, we‚Äôll search for pods running container images that are vulnerable to remote code execution.\r\n\r\n**1.\tStart by searching for pods.**\r\n\r\n![](../Images/querypods1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n**2.\tClick on the plus sign and select ‚Äúapplication‚Äù then ‚ÄúIs running‚Äù then select ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù:**\r\n\r\n![](../Images/querypods2.png?raw=true)\r\n \r\n**3.\tClick on the plus sign next to ‚ÄúContainers and select ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù and ‚ÄúIs running‚Äù again to add the container images:**\r\n\r\n![](../Images/querypods3.png?raw=true)\r\n \r\n**4.\tClick on the plus sign next to Container images and select ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù then ‚ÄúVulnerable to remote code execution.‚Äù**\r\n\r\n![](../Images/querypods4.png?raw=true)\r\n \r\n**5.\tThe query is complete! Click search to view the results. You should see the three pods we onboarded.**\r\n![](../Images/querypods5.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Exercise 3: Investigate attack paths**\r\nIn exercise one, we exposed our Kubernetes Service to the internet and ran a high severity image on the cluster. This triggered the attack path ‚ÄúInternet exposed Kubernetes pod is running a container with high severity vulnerabilities‚Äù. To investigate the attack path, navigate to the Defender for Cloud portal and click:\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tRecommendations\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tAttack paths\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢\tSelect the attack path mentioned above\r\n\r\n![](../Images/containersattackpath.png?raw=true)\r\n \r\nIn the attach path, you will notice it detected the namespace ‚Äúmdc-dcspm-demo‚Äù, container ‚Äúhello-contoso‚Äù and the image ‚Äúmdc-mock-001‚Äù, all of which we deployed in Exercise 1. With the attack path, you can see all the resource types involved in this path as well as how they are related. For example, the attack path shows you that the ‚Äúmdc-dcspm-demo‚Äù is contained inside the asclab cluster and routes traffic to the service we deployed for internet exposure.\r\nTo see how to remediate the attack path, scroll down to the ‚ÄúRemediation Steps‚Äù and navigate to the ‚ÄúRecommendations‚Äù tab. \r\n\r\n![](../Images/attackpathVArecommendation.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:30.886829"}

On the **Inventory** tile, you are provided with a view of your security posture across all your inventory, including Defender coverage per resource and whether the monitoring agent is installed (which brinhs security protection to those resources).\n![Overview: Secure Score tile](../Images/mdfc-inventory.png?raw=true) \n13.\tOn the right pane, you can find the **Insights** section which offers tailored items for your environments: \n\n- Upgrade to New Containers plan\n- Cost estimation workbook for Containers plan\n- Most prevalent recommendations (by resources)\n- Controls with the highest potential increase\n- Defender for Cloud community\n- Most attacked resources\n- New security alerts\n- Blog post from Microsoft experts [MDC blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/bg-p/AzureSecurityCenterBlog)\n- Link to the [mdc Community repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center)\n\n### Exercise 2: Exploring Secure Score and Recommendations\n\n**Exploring Secure Score**\n\nPreviously, we briefly explored the Secure Score tile on the overview page. Now let‚Äôs dive into this capability and the associated recommendations. Microsoft Defender for Cloud continually assesses your resources. All findings are aggregated into a single score (Secure Score) which measures your current security posture of your subscription/s; the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.\nExploring secure score\n\n1.\tGo to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Overview blade**.\n2.\tFrom the left navigation pane, under the **Cloud Security** section, press on the **Secure posture** button.\n3.\tOn the Secure Score page, **review your current overall secure score percentrage**.\n\n> ‚≠ê Notice: <br>\n> Your score is shown as a percentage value, but you can also see the breakdown by cloud environment and criticallity rating. See the following example: <br>\n> ![Overall Secure Score](../Images/module2_securescore_percentage_yl.png?raw=true)<br>\n> For more information on how the score is calculated, [refer to the secure score documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/secure-score-security-controls#how-your-secure-score-is-calculated).\n\n4.\tOn the bottom part, you can see a list of subscriptions and their current score. To view the recommendations behind the score, click on **view recommendations**.\n\n**Exploring Security Controls and Recommendations**\n\n1.\tOn the recommendations page, pay attention to the first part of the page; the **summary view** which includes a breakdown of recommendations by criticallity, the number of active attack paths, and the number of overdue recommendations.  \n2.\tOn the top menu, click on **Download CSV report** button ‚Äì this allow you to get a snapshot of your resources, their health status and the associated recommendations. You can use it for pivoting and reporting.\n3.\tNotice the second part of the page; here you have a **list of all recommendations grouped by criticallity**:\n\n4.\tIn the search bar, look for the recommendation `Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled`.  Click on this recommendation. You will be taken to a page dedicated to presenting the assessment for a particular instance.  ![Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled](../Images/module2_specificRecommendation.png)  Notice that we display the overall risk level, number of active attack paths, the governance owner (if set), due date, ServiceNow Ticket ID,, and compounding risk factors.  \n5.\tTo view all resources that have this applicable recommendation, click `View recommendation for all resources`.  As you can see, this recommendation has the **Quick Fix** available.\n\n> ‚≠ê Notice: <br>\n> Quick Fix allows you to remediate a group of resources quickly when possible with a single click. This option is only available for supported recommendations and enables you to quickly improve your secure score and increase the security in your environment.\n\n6.\tOn the top section, notice the following:\n\n*\t**Deny** (the options are Enforce and Deny buttons on supported recommendations)\n*\t**Exempt** (which allows you to exempt resources/subscriptions/management groups from being applicable to this recommendation)\n*\t**View Policy Definition** (which opens the Azure Policy definition for this recommendation)\n*\t**Open Query** (in Azure Resource Graph)\n\n* Severity indicator: **High**\n* Refreshens interval on supported recommendations: **30 Min**\n\n![Recommendation top menu](../Images/asc-storage-top-menu.jpg?raw=true)\n \n7. The next important part is the **Remediation Steps** which contains the remediation logic. Expand **Remediation steps** to see more information.  As you can see, you can remediate the select resource/s either by following the step-by-step instructions, use the provided ARM template or REST API to automate the process by yourself or use the Quick Fix button which triggers the ARM call for you.\n\n* Click on the **Quick Fix Logic**\n* Notice the automatic remediation script content (ARM Template):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"supportsHttpsTrafficOnly\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n8.\tOn the bottom part, click on the unhealthy resources tab and **select a resource** and then **click Fix**.\n\n9. On the right pane, review the implications for this remediation and press **Fix 1 resource**.\n\n![Remediate a resource](../Images/asc-storage-remediate-resource.gif?raw=true)\n\n10. Wait for a notification: ‚úÖ **Fix successful** - Successfully remediated the issues on the selected \nresources. Note: It can take several minutes after remediation completes to see the resources in the 'healthy resources' tab.\n\n11.\tReturn to recommendations list. Expend the \"Manage access and permissions\" security control, you can now see **Preview recommendations** which have the flag symbol to the right, under **Insights**. Those with **Preview recommendations** aren‚Äôt included in the calculation of your score. They should be still remediated, so that when the preview period ends, they will contribute towards your score.\n![Remediate a resource](../Images/module2_recommendations_previewrecommendations_yl.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\n### Exercise 3: Exploring the Inventory capability\n\nAsset inventory dashboard allows you to get a single pane of glass view to all your resources covered by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. It also provides per-resource visibility to all Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs information and additional resource details including security posture and protection status. Since this dashboard is based on Azure Resource Graph (ARG), you can run queries across subscriptions at scale quickly and easily.\n\n1.\tFrom Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs sidebar or from the Overview tile, select **Inventory**\n2.\tHover to the top of the page.\n3.\tNotice the total number of resources: **15**\n\n> ‚≠ê Notice: <br>\n> The total number of resources are the ones which are connected to Microsoft Defender for Cloud and NOT the total number of resources that you have in your subscriptions/s.\n\n4.\tNotice the number of **unhealthy resources: 11** (resources with active recommendations based on the selected filter)\n5.\tNotice the **unmonitored resources: 0** (indicates if there are resources with Log Analytics agent deployed but with health issues). Since we enabled the auto-provisioning in the previous module, all existing VMs are covered and connected = monitored.\n6.\tUse the **Filter by name** box to search for **linux**. You should now see a filtered view of the disks in your environments.  Clear the filter.\n7.\tOpen the resource health pane by selecting the resource. Click on **asclab-linux**. \n8.\tOn the resource health pane for **asclab-linux**, review the virtual machine information alongside with a recommendation list.\n![Remediate a resource](../Images/Lab2rh.jpg?raw=true)\n9.\tNavigate back to the **Inventory page**. From the filter menu, select the **Resource Group** filter and then **asclab-aks**. Using this filter, you can see all resources related to the predefined Kubernetes resources which are monitored with no active recommendations.

In this module, you will learn how to enable the integration.\n\n### Exercise 1: Enable auto-deployment of and integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint\n\n[Defender for Servers Plan 1 and Plan 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan) include integration and license coverage for [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/endpoint-defender). Together, they provide comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities, software inventory, and vulnerability assessments leveraging [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/defender-for-cloud/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management).\nAs soon as Defender for Endpoint detects a threat, it triggers a security alert that is shown in both, Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft 365 Defender. From Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can also pivot to the Defender for Endpoint console, and perform a detailed investigation to uncover the scope of the attack.\n\nIntegration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management is enabled by default once you enable one of the two Defender for Servers plans. To control the current configuration, you can\n\n1.  Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, then **Environment settings**.\n2.  Select the relevant subscription.\n3.  Locate **Servers**.\n4.\tClick on **Settings** and ensure **Endpoint protection** and **Vulnerability assessment for machines** are toggled **On**.\n5.  Click **Continue** and **Save**. \n\nAs soon as you have enabled the integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Cloud will automatically deploy the MDE.Windows and MDE.Linux extensions to your Windows and Linux Azure VMs and non-Azure machines running Azure Arc-enabled Servers. As soon as the extension is deployed, an onboarding package will analyze the machine and\n- ignore any Linux machines that are running other fanotify-based security solutions (see details of the fanotify kernel extension required in [Linux system requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux#system-requirements))\n- detect any previous installations of Defender for Endpoint and reconfigure them to integrate with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n\nOnboarding of the MDE agent will start within an hour. However, it can take up to 12 hours before vulnerability assessment results are shown in the **Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved** recommendation. The onboarding is completed as soon as the extension has been installed and is in **Provisioning succeeded** state.\n\n![](../Images/m22-mdeextension.png?raw=true)\n\n### Exercise 2: Connect your on-premises servers via direct onboarding\nWhile the onboarding scenario in exercise 1 will require Azure Arc to be installed first so Defender for Cloud's backend process can deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to your non-Azure machines, there is another capability called direct onboarding that allows Defender for Cloud to detect any server in Defender for Endpoint's backend and connect it to Defender for Cloud using a backend integration between both services, offering integration and license coverage.\n\nTo enable direct onboarding, follow these steps:\n1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, then **Environment settings**.\n2. Click the **Direct onboarding** tile\n   ![](../Images/m22-directonboarding.png?raw=true)\n3. Toggle **Direct onboarding** on and select a **Designated subscription**.\n   ![](../Images/m22-directonboarding2.png?raw=true)\n4. Click **Save**.\n\nIn case Defender for Servers has not already been enabled on the designated subscription before enabling direct onboarding, Defender for Cloud will automatically enable Defender for Servers Plan 1 on this subscription. As a next step, Defender for Cloud will now detect all servers in your [Defender for Endpoint backend](https://security.microsoft.com) and connect them to Defender for Cloud. In order to manually deploy Defender for Endpoint to your server, please follow these steps:\n1. Login to [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).\n2. Navigate to **Settings**, then **Endpoints**.\n3. Under **Device management**, find **Onboarding**.\n4. Select your server's operating system and follow the installation instructions.\n\nAs soon as your machine is successfully onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, it will be connected to Defender for Cloud. Security alerts, Software inventory and vulnerability assessment findings will now be available in Defender for Cloud and Microsoft 365 Defender.\n\n### Exercise 3: Analyze vulnerability assessment findings in custom workbooks\nAs soon as Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) will report vulnerability assessment results for your machine, Defender for Cloud will show them in the **Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved** security recommendation. At the same time, these results will also be available via Azure Resource Graph (ARG), where you can query them using Kusto Query Language (KQL). We have released a custom [CVE Dashboard](https://aka.ms/CVEDashboard) that you can deploy from this Github repository by following the link and clicking on **Deploy to Azure**.\n\nThe workbook will show vulnerability assessment results based on CVE IDs, including information about affected machines and software. You can also filter by using the plain text search bar on top of every table.\n\n![](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Workbooks/CVE%20Dashboard/tab1.png)", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:31.137032"}

These security policies are made of security standards and recommendations that help you improve your cloud security posture. Security standards are made of [Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-regulatory-compliance), Regulatory compliance standards and custom standards. \nBy the end of this exercise, you will know how to create exemptions, policy enforcements and custom policies.  \n\n#### Prerequisites\nTo get started with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you must have a subscription to Microsoft Azure. Please go through [Module 1](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Modules/Module-1-Preparing-the-Environment.md) to get started with a free subscription. \n\n### Exercise 1: Overview of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud policy\n\n1. On Microsoft Defender for Cloud blade, from the left navigation pave, click on **Environment Settings**. \n2. Then select **Subscription 1** and from the left navigation select **Security policy**.\n3. Under the **Standards** tab, you will see MCSB and 241 recommendations. **Type** is **Default**. This is because MCSB is assigned by default when a management group or subscription is onboarded to Defender for Cloud.  \n\nNote: As mentioned earlier, this is the default and was automatically assigned as part of onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. The default assignment contains only audit policies. For more information please visit https://aka.ms/ascpolicies. MCSB is a holistic collection of security recommendations and best practices from not only Azure but also your multi-cloud environment. \n\n4.\tClick on the assign assignment: **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark**. Notice **Effect** is **Audit**. Microsoft Defender for Cloud assesses your environment and audits data. It does not enforce without your approval.\n5.\tGo back to the **Security policies** page. Click on **Recommendations** tab. Notice **Source** changes from **Defender for Cloud** and **Azure Policy**. Also take note of **Standards** column.  \n\n\n### Exercise 2: Explore Azure Policy\n1.\tOn Azure Portal, navigate to **Policy blade**. You can use the search box on the upper part for \"Policy\" or navigate to: https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyMenuBlade\n2.\tFrom the left navigation pane, under the **Authoring** section, click on **Definitions** to explore the built-in policy definitions and initiatives.\n3.\tFrom the top menu, use the filter button to set Category as **Security Center** and deselect **All**. Under **Definitions type**, select **Initiative** and deselect **All**.\n4.\tYou can now see built-in initiatives used by Microsoft Defender for Cloud, some in Preview.\n5. Notice the number of policies included in each initiative (policies column)\n6. Now exit.\n\n### Exercise 3: Create resource exemption for a recommendation\n\nResource exemption will allow increased granularity for you to fine-tune recommendations by providing the ability to exempt certain resources from evaluation.\nWhen working with a recommendation, you can create an exemption by clicking the ellipsis menu on the right side and then select create exemption.\n\nNote: Exemptions is a premium Azure policy capability that's offered for Microsoft Defender for Cloud customers with no additional cost. For other users, charges may apply in the future.\n\n1.\tOpen **Microsoft Defender for Cloud blade** and from the left navigation pane and select **Recommendations**.\n2.\tType in **\"management ports**.\n3.\tSelect the **Management ports should be closed on your virtual machines** recommendation.\n4.\tOn the list of **unhealthy resources**, see the current resources: *asclab-win* and *asclab-linux*.\n5.\tSelect the **asclab-win** resource and then click on **Create exemption**.\n\n![Create exemption](../Images/asc-management-ports-resource-exemption.gif?raw=true)\n\n6.\tThe create **exemption pane** opens:\n   *\tKeep the default name.\n*\tClick the expiration button ON and set datetime for two days ahead on 12:00 AM.\n\n    - Select **Waiver** as exemption category.\n    - Provide a description: **Testing exemption capability ‚Äì module 3**.\n    - Select **Save**.\n  \n  ![Modifying Microsoft Defender for Cloud default policy assignment](../Images/Inkedlab3pl6.gif?raw=true)\n  \n> ‚≠ê Good to know: <br>\n> **Mitigated** - This issue isn't relevant to the resource because it's been handled by a different tool or process than the one being suggested\n> **Waiver** - Accepting the risk for this resource\n\n7.\tIt might take up to **30 min for exemption to take effect**. Once this happens:\n    - The resource doesn't impact your secure score.\n    - The resource is listed in the Not applicable tab of the recommendation details page\n    - The information strip at the top of the recommendation details page lists the number of exempted resources: **1**\n\n8.\tOpen the **Not applicable** tab to review your exempted resource ‚Äì you can see our resource along with the reason / description value.\n9.\tExemption rules is based on Azure Policy capability. Therefore, you can track all your exemptions from Azure Policy blade as well.\n10.\tNavigate to **Azure Policy blade** and select **Exemptions** from the left navigation pane. Notice your newly created exemption listed there.\n\n### Exercise 4: Create a policy enforcement and deny\n\n1.\tFrom **Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar**, select **Recommendations**.\n2.  Search for **Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled**.\n3.\tFrom the top menu bar, click on **Deny** button. *Enforce and Deny options provide you another way to improve your score by preventing security misconfigurations*.\n\n> ‚ùó Important: <br>\n> Security misconfigurations are a major cause of security incidents\n\n4.\tOn the **Deny - Prevent resource creation**, select **Azure subscription 1** (which is currently set to audit mode). This allow you to ensure that from now on, storage account without the security transfer feature turned on will be denied.\n\n![Prevent resource creation](../Images/asc-storage-deny-policy.gif?raw=true)\n\n5.\tGo back to the **Recommendations view**, and remove the Deny-only filter. From the search area, type **Auditing**. Click on the recommendation **Auditing on SQL server should be enabled**.\n\n![Auditing on SQL server should be enabled](../Images/asc-auditing-sql.gif?raw=true)\n\n6.\tOn the recommendations page, from the top menu bar, click on **Enforce** button. Using this option allow you to take advantage of Azure policy‚Äôs DeployIfNotExist effect and automatically remediate non-compliant resources upon creation.\n7.\tOnce the configuration pane opens with all of the policy configuration options, select the following configuration settings:\n\n* On Scope, select your subscription. **Click Select**.\n* Click **Next**\n* Keep retention days as is and select then resource group **asclab**\nSelect **Review + create** to assign the policy on your subscription.\n* Click **Create**\n\n9. On the recommendation page, **select** the SQL Server resource found on the **unhealthy resources** tab (asclab-sql-xxx) and click **Remediate**. Click **Remediate 1 resource**. By doing both operations, you can now be ensure your existing resources and new ones will be enabled for auditing. Auditing on your SQL Server helps you track database activities across all databases on the server and save them in an audit log.\n10.\t[Click here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/secure-score-security-controls#secure-score-controls) to review a list of security controls and their recommendations.\n\n### Exercise 5: Create a custom recommendation\n\n***Create a custom initiative using KQL Query***\nFor this exercise, we will use an existing recommendation ([Preview]: Storage account public access should be disallowed) to create a custom one. \n1.\tNavigate to **Security Policy** for your subscription.\n2.\tSelect **Create recommendation** from the **+Create** drop down on the top.\n3.\tOn the **Create a new recommendation** page, provide the following:\n    - Name: customrecommendation_module3\n    - Description: [Preview]: Storage account public access should be disallowed\n    - Remediation description: Anonymous public read access to containers and blobs in Azure Storage is a convenient way to share data but might present security risks. To prevent data breaches caused by undesired anonymous access, Microsoft recommends preventing public access to a storage account unless your scenario requires it.\n    - Severity:  High\n    - Security issue: Anonymous Access\n  \n4.\tUse the query editor to build or test your KQL Query. Once that's done add your query to the **Recommendation query**. \n7. Select **Next**. Click **Save**.\n8. In a few minutes, navigate back to **Security policies** under your subscription.\n9. Click on the **Recommendations** tab and you should see the custom policy we just created.\n\nLearn more about custom recommendations and standards by visiting this [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/create-custom-recommendations)\n\n### Continue with the next lab: [Module 4 - Regulatory Compliance](../Modules/Module-4-Regulatory-Compliance.md)\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:31.245507"}
{"source": "github", "repo": "Azure/Azure-Security-Center", "file": "Labs/Modules/Module-4-Regulatory-Compliance.md", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Modules/Module-4-Regulatory-Compliance.md", "content": "# Module 4 - Regulatory Compliance\n\n<p align=\"left\"><img src=\"../Images/asc-labs-intermediate.gif?raw=true\"></p>\n\n#### üéì Level: 200 (Intermediate)\n#### ‚åõ Estimated time to complete this lab: 60 minutes\n\n## Objectives\nThis exercise guides you through the current Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Regulatory Compliance feature. Defender for Cloud helps customers meet such requirements by assessing their resources' posture against a particular standard through the Regulatory Compliance dashboard. This exercise will walk you through this feature, but for official documentation visit this [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/regulatory-compliance-dashboard).  \n\n### Exercise 1: Understanding Regulatory Compliance dashboard\n\n1.\tFrom **Microsoft Defender for Cloud main dashboard**, select **Regulatory Compliance** tile (this pilar is also available from the sidebar under Cloud Security).\n2.\tRegulatory Compliance dashboard opens. On this page, you can see the compliance standards currently assigned to your subscription.\n3.\tOn the top strip, notice the number of **passed controls** for Microsoft cloud security benchmark.\n\n### Exercise 2: Adding new standards in Azure and multicloud\n\nYou can add additional industry standards (represented as compliance packages) such as IST SP 800-53 R4, SWIFT CSP CSCF-v2020, UK Official and more.\n\n1.\tFrom the top menu bar in Regulatory Compliance, select **Manage compliance policies**.\n2.\tSelect your subsciption.\n<br> Note: <br>\nIf you want to assign a standard in AWS or GCP, choose an AWS or GCP connection and then go directly to **Security policies** on the left. Available compliance standards in all three clouds are documented [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-regulatory-compliance-standards#available-compliance-standards). \n<br> Another note: <br>\nModules [10](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Modules/Module-10-GCP.md) and [11](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Labs/Modules/Module-11-AWS.md) will walk through creating those multicloud connectors. Feel free to skip to those modules and then come back. \n3.  Select **Security policies**. \n4.\tUnder the **Standards** tab, look for *CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0*.\n5.  Select the standard. \n6.  Notice the number of **audit** and **manual** policy definitions. \n**Audit effect**: When a resource does not adhere to the specific policy definition, Policy will mark said resource as **non-compliant** and create a warning in the activity log but it won't take action on the actual resource. Visit this[page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effect-audit) to learn more about the audit effect. \n**Manual effect**: Sometimes, when some operations or tasks cannot be automated or requires updating of resource's compliance state, manual attestation is required. To learn more about this, check out this [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effect-manual). \n7.  Search for **rotation** in the search box. **Keys should have a rotation policy ensuring that their rotation is scheduled within the specified number of days after creation.** should come up. Notice **Additional parameters** is set to **Configured**. \n8.  Click on the ellipses to **view policy definition**. \nWhen assigning this standard to your scope (subscription or management group), you will be asked to input a value of the maximum days to rotate keys, per this policy definition. \n9.  Navigate back to the **Standards** page and click toggle **On** for *CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0*. \n10.  Input the value that adheres to your organization's policy or, for this lab purpose only, input **30**. \n11.  In a few hours, this new standard will display in the **Regulatory Compliance** dashbard, next to the default MCSB. \n> ‚ùó Important: <br>\n> It will take a while until the change takes an effect (2-3 hours).\n  \n### Exercise 3: Exploring a benchmark \n1. Navigate to the standard you've chosen for Exercise 2. For the lab, we chose *CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0*. Notice the different compliance controls mapped to assessments.\n2.\tSearch for **Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled.**\n3.\tClick to open **Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled.**\n4.\tIn the new pane, tick the box for the unhealthy resource titled asclabXXXXXX, and select **Fix** at the bottom of the page. \n5.\tThen in the pop-up tab click Fix 1 resource. Your Storage account now has secure transfer enabled.\n6.\tReturn to the dashboard. You can export regulatory standard compliance status as a PDF report or CSV file. From the top menu bar, select **Download report**.\n7.\tOn the Report standard dropdown menu, select *CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0* and **PDF**. Click **Download**\n8. A local PDF file is now stored on your machine. Open the **CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0** and explore the compliance report ‚Äì This report summarizes the status of those assessments on your environment, as they map to the associated controls.\n\n### Exercise 4: Creating your own benchmark!\nFor the sake of simplicity, while you can create your own \"benchmark\", we will use the term \"standard\" in this exericse. A standard can be made up of one or more recommendations. \nOnce you create your custom standard, Defender for Cloud allows you to add it as security policy and which provides two main benefits:\n* Having security requirements represent as custom recommendations under the recommendation list.\n* Having a way to track compliance status using Regulatory Compliance dashboard.\n1.\tNavigate to Regulatory Compliance in Defender for Cloud.\n2.\tFrom the top menu, select **Manage compliance standards** to create custom standard.\n3.\tSelect a scope as a location for the new definition. The recommended approach is to select management groups if they have been assigned but in our scenario select your subscription as the scope.\n4.\tSelect **Security policies**.\n5.\tClick on **+Custom standard** from the **+Create** dropdown on top. \n6.  Provide a name like \"Module 4 custom standard\".\n7.  Add a description.\n8.  Now you can choose the different recommendations you want to have as part of this standard. \n9.  Click **Create**.\n10.\tYou will be redirected to the **Security policies** page. Sort by **Status** to see your newly created standard applied to your subscription.\n![module4_customstandard](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/assets/45104504/aba2680c-9d1e-4fae-bb98-63ea3627c9a4)\n\n\n### Exercise 5 Azure Audit Reports\n\nNow in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can easily create & download Audit reports for Regulatory Compliance Standards.\n1.\tFrom Microsoft Defender for Cloud, select Regulatory Compliance from the sidebar\n2.\tThen click on Audit Reports found at the top of the page\n![Regulatory compliance assessment and standards](../Images/lab4rc6.jpg?raw=true)\n3.\tSelect PCI from the tabs, and download 2021 - Azure PCI 3DS 1.0 Package, and click download\n![Regulatory compliance assessment and standards](../Images/lab4rc7.jpg?raw=true)\n4.\tPress download on the Privacy Notice pop-up that appears.\nYou now have the audit report downloaded.\n\n\n### Exercise 6 Continuous Export & Compliance over time workbook\n\nCompliance dashboard over time is a Workbook in Microsoft Defender for Cloud dedicated to tracking a subscription's compliance with the regulatory or industry standards applied to it. Read more about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks#compliance-over-time-workbook). To leverage this workbook, you'll need to configure continuous export first to export data to a Log Analytics workspace:\n1.\tFrom Microsoft Defender for Cloud's sidebar, select **Environment Settings**.\n2.\tSelect the subscription for which you want to configure the data export.\n3.\tFrom the sidebar of the settings page for that subscription, select **Continuous Export**.\n4.\tClick on the **Log Analytics workspace**. Set the export enable to **On** (which is the tab beside Event hub).\n5.\tLeave settings as is. Check off box next to **Regulatory compliance** and choose **Select All**\n6.\tFrom the export frequency options, select both **Streaming updates** and **Snapshots**.\n7.\tSelect target workspace and the Resource Group to be those you created earlier.\n9.\tSelect Save. You might get a message about Sentinel alerts connector already enabled. Click **Confirm**.\n10.\tWait for the first snapshot to occur. \n\nCompliance dashboard over time \n1.\tGo to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and from the left navigation pane, under the **General** section, choose on the **Workbooks** button. \n2.\tSelect **Compliance Over Time** workbook located under **Defender for Cloud**.\n3.\tFor the workspace, select **asclab-la-XXXXXXXXXX** \n4.\tFor the subscription, select your subscription.\n5.\tFor the standard name, select **All**, and now you can see the workbook.\n![Regulatory compliance assessment and standards](../Images/lab4rc11.jpg?raw=true)\n>Note 1: You need to complete the previous exercise of setting up Continuous Export to the Log Analytics workspace for the Compliance Over Time Workbook to work.\n>Note 2: If you see the error below, you will need to wait for a week for this workbook to populate with data through Continuous Export.\n![Regulatory compliance assessment and standards](../Images/lab4rc12.gif?raw=true)\n\n\n### Continue with the next lab: [Module 5 - Improving your Secure Posture](../Modules/Module-5-Improving-your-Secure-Posture.md)\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:31.564624"}

Once the vulnerability assessment scanner is deployed, it continually assesses all the installed applications on a virtual machine to find vulnerabilities and presents its findings in the Microsoft Defender for Cloud console. When a machine is found that doesn't have *vulnerability* assessment solution deployed, Microsoft Defender for Cloud generates a recommendation: *Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution*. To remediate a resource, you can click on the Quick Fix button to deploy the necessary VM extension.\n\n**Explore vulnerability assessment recommendations:**\n\n1.\tFrom Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar, click on **Recommendations**.\n2.\tExpend **Remediate vulnerabilities** security control (which contains all recommendations related to security vulnerabilities).\n3.\tMake sure you have *Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution* recommendation. If you don‚Äôt have this recommendation on the list, you will probably need 24 hours to have the recommendation with the assessment.\n4.\tOpen the **Machines should have a vulnerability assessment solution‚Äù recommendation** ‚Äì this recommendation is a Quick Fix one which allows you to deploy the VM extension on the desired VMs.\n5.\tExpend **Remediation steps** ‚Äì in addition to the Quick Fix remediation option, you can also use the **view quick fix logic** option to expose an automatic remediation script content (ARM template). **Close this window.**\n6.\tFrom the unhealthy tab, select both *asclab-win* and *aslab-linux* virtual machines. Click **Fix**.\n7.\tOn the **Choose a vulnerability assessment solution** select **Recommended: Deploy ASC integrated vulnerability scanner powered by Qualys (included in Microsoft Defender for Cloud for servers)**. Click **Proceed**.\n8.\tA window opens, review the list of VMs and click **Remediate 2 resource** button.\n9.\tRemediation is now in process. Microsoft Defender for Cloud will deploy the Qualys VM extension on the selected VMs, so you track the status using the notification area or by using Azure activity log. Wait 5-10 minutes for the process to complete.\n\n> Note: You can find a list of supported operating systems [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm#deploy-the-integrated-scanner-to-your-azure-and-hybrid-machines).\n\n10.\tEnsure the VM extension is deployed on the relevant machines:\n    - From Azure Portal, open **Virtual Machines**.\n    - Select **asclab-win**.\n    - From the sidebar, click on **Extensions**.\n    - Make sure to have `MDE.Windows` extension installed and successfully provisioned.\n    - Repeat the process for **asclab-linux** ‚Äì you should expect to see a different name for the extension on Linux platform: `MDE.Linux`.\n\n> Note: There are multiple ways you can automate the process where you need to achieve at scale deployment. More details are available on our [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm#automate-at-scale-deployments) and on [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/built-in-vulnerability-assessment-for-vms-in-azure-security/ba-p/1577947).\n\n11.\tThe VA agent will now collect all required artifacts, send them to Qualys Cloud and findings will be presented back on ASC console within 24 hours.\n\n**View and remediate vulnerability assessment findings:**\n\n1.\tFrom Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar, click on **Recommendations**.\n2.\tExpend **Remediate vulnerabilities** security control (which contains all recommendations related to security vulnerabilities).\n3.\tSearch for **Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved**.\n4.\tOn the Security Checks, you should see a list of vulnerabilities found on the affected resources.\n5.\tOn the recommendation, expend **Affected resources**. You should see two unhealthy resources (asclab-win and asclab-linux) and not applicable resources.\n6.\tFrom the **Unhealthy resources**, select **asclab-win** resource. Here you can view all relevant recommendations for that resource.\n7.\tFrom the findings list, click on the highest vulnerability located at the top (ID 376813).\n8.\tNotice the vulnerability details on the information pane including the description, impact, severity, remediation steps, etc.\n\n### Exercise 2: Vulnerability assessment for Containers\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud scans images in your ACR (Azure Container Registry) that are pushed to the registry, imported into the registry, or any images pulled within the last 30 days.\nThen, it exposes detailed findings per image. All vulnerabilities can be found in the following recommendation: Vulnerabilities in Azure Container Registry images should be remediated (powered by Qualys).\n\nTo simulate a container registry image with vulnerabilities, we will use ACR tasks commands and sample image:\n\n1. On the Azure portal, navigate to **Container registries** blade or click [here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry%2Fregistries).\n2. Copy the name or your container registry, for example: *asclabcrktfvrxcne4kki*\n3.\tOpen [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) using the bash environment.\n4.\tBuild a Linux container image from the hello-world image hosted at Microsoft Container Registry and push it to the existing Azure Container Registry instance on your subscription:\n\nRun the the following two script blocks:\n\n```\necho FROM mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld > Dockerfile\n```\n\nModify the following script to include your container registry name:\n\n```\naz acr build --image sample/hello-world:v1 --registry <your container registry name> --file Dockerfile .\n```\n\n![Build Linux container in Cloud Shell](../Images/asc-build-linux-container-cloud-shell.gif?raw=true)\n\n5. Wait for a successful execution message to appear. For example: Run ID: cb1 was successful after 23s\n6.\tThe scan completes typically within few minutes, but it might take up to 15 minutes for the vulnerabilities/security findings to appear on the recommendation.\n7.\tFrom Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar, click on **Recommendations**.\n8.\tExpand **Remediate vulnerabilities** security control and select **Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved**.\n9.\tOn the recommendation page, notice the following details at the upper section:\n    - Unhealthy registries: *1/1*\n    - Severity of recommendation: *High*\n    - Total vulnerabilities: *expect to see 2 or more vulnerabilities*\n10.\tExpend the **Affected resources** section and notice the **Unhealthy registries** count which shows **1 container registry** (asclab-xxx).\n11.\tOn the **Security Checks** section, notice the number of vulnerabilities.\n12.\tClick on the first security check to open the right pane. Notice the vulnerability description, general information, remediation, and the affected resources. **Close this window.**\n\n![](../Images/Lab5vul2.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Exercise 3: Automate recommendations with workflow automation\n\nEvery security program includes multiple workflows for incident response. These processes might include notifying relevant stakeholders, launching a change management process, and applying specific remediation steps.\nUsing workflow automation, you can trigger logic apps to automate processes in real-time with Microsoft Defender for Cloud events (security alerts or recommendations).\nIn this lab, you will create a new Logic App and then trigger it automatically using workflow automation feature when there is a change with a specific recommendation.\n\n**Create a new Logic App:**\n1.\tOn the Azure Portal, type *Logic Apps* on the search field at the top or [click here](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Logic%2Fworkflows).\n2.\tClick **Add** to create a new Logic App.\n3.\tOn the Basics tab, select **Azure subscription 1** and resource group **asclab**.\n4.\tOn the Logic app name field enter a unique name such as *SendRecommendationsChanges12* (Note: There will be an error if the Logic app name is not unique) .\n5.\tSelect location, for example: **West Europe** (it‚Äôs recommended to use the same region as used in the previous exercises).\n6.\tUnder the Plan section, **select consumption**. \n7.\tLeave all other options as per the default.\n8.\tSelect **Review + Creation** and then **Create**.\n9.\tThe Logic Apps Designer opens, select **Blank Logic App**.\n10.\tAt the search control, type *Microsoft Defender for Cloud* and select **When an Microsoft Defender for Cloud Recommendation is created or triggered**.\n11. Click on new step and type *Outlook.com*.\n12. Scroll down the list, and click **Send an email (V2)** action to add it to the Designer.\n\n> Note: you will need to sign into your Outlook.com (Microsoft Account) and grant permissions for the Logic App to send email using your account.\n> \n13.\tIn the Send an email (V2), add your email address to the **To** field.\n\n> Later, you will use that email address to check if you received an email using workflow automation feature.\n\n14.\tClick in the **Subject box**, then type: *Recommendation changed:*\n15.\tClick just after Recommendation changed: to get your cursor in the right place. In the dynamic content box, click on **Dynamic content** and then select `Properties Display Name` (click Add dynamic content if it doesn‚Äôt pop out automatically).\n15.\tClick into the Body text box and type the following:\n\n**The following recommendation has been changed**</br>\n**Recommendation:**</br>\n**Description:**</br>\n**Status:**</br>\n**Link to recommendation:**</br>\n\n16.\tClick just after each section, to get your cursor in the right place. In the **dynamic content box**, click on **See more** and match each line to the following content:\n\nRecommendation: `Properties Display Name`</br>\nDescription: `Properties Metadata Description`</br>\nStatus: `Properties Status Code`</br>\nLink to recommendation: `Properties Links Azure Portal Uri`</br>\n\n17.\tYour Logic App should now look like the below screenshot. If so, click on **Save** in the Logic App Designer.\n\n![Logic App worklfow](../Images/asc-logic-app-workflow.gif?raw=true)\n\n**Create a new workflow automation instance**\n1.\tFrom Microsoft Defender for Cloud's sidebar, select **Workflow automation** which is found under the **Management** section.\n2.\tClick **Add workflow automation**.\n3.\tA pane appears on the right side. Enter the following for each field:\n    - General:\n        - Name: *Send-RecommendationsChanges*\n        - Description: *Send email message when a recommendation is created or triggered*\n        - Subscription: *Azure subscription 1*\n        - Resource group: *asclab*\n    - Trigger conditions:\n        - Select Microsoft Defender for Cloud data types: *Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations*\n        - Recommendations name: *All recommendations selected*\n        - Recommendation severity: *All severities selected*\n        - Recommendation state: *All states selected*\n    - Actions:\n        - Show Logic App instances from the following subscriptions: *Azure subscription 1*\n        - Logic App name: *Send-RecommendationsChanges*\n    Click **Create** to complete the task.\n4.\tWait for the banner *Workflow automation created successfully. Changes may take up to 5 minutes to be reflected*. From now on, you will get email notifications for recommendations.\nOnce you start to get email notifications, you can disable the automation by selecting the workflow and clicking on **Disable**.\n\n> Please be aware that if your trigger is a recommendation that has \"sub-recommendations‚Äù / ‚Äúnested recommendations‚Äù, the logic app will not trigger for every new security finding; only when the status of the parent\n\n5. Once the automation is automatically triggered, you should expect the email message to look like the screenshot below:\n\n![Workflow automation generated email message](../Images/asc-workflow-automation-automated-email.gif?raw=true)\n\n6.\tTest/trigger your automation manually:\n    - On Microsoft Defender for Cloud sidebar, click on **Recommendations**.\n    - Look for any recommendations that has a Quick Fix banner (which is the lightning symbol to the right of the recommendation).\n    - Select a resource and then click on **Trigger Logic App** button.\n    - In the Logic App Trigger blade, select the Logic App you created in the previous step (SendRecommendationsChanges).\n    - You should receive an email containing ...\n7.\tFrom the top menu in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, click on **Guides & Feedback**.\n8.\tHere you can learn more about workflow automation, get useful links and explore our community tools from the GitHub repository.\n9.\tClick on **Community tools** and then **View all community tools**.\n\n### Exercise 4: Accessing your secure score via ARG\nAzure Resource Graph (ARG) provide an efficient and performant resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across a given set of subscriptions.\nAzure Secure Score data is available in ARG so you can query and calculate your score for the security controls and accurately calculate the aggregated score across multiple subscription.\n\n1.\tFrom the Azure Portal, search for *Resource Graph Explorer* (or arg).\n\n![Resource Graph Explorer](../Images/asc-resource-graph-explorer.gif?raw=true)\n\n2.\tPaste the following KQL query and then select **Run query**.\n\n```\nSecurityResources\n| where type == 'microsoft.security/securescores'\n| extend current = properties.score.current, max = todouble(properties.score.max)\n| project subscriptionId, current, max, percentage = ((current / max)*100)\n```\n\n3.\tYou should now see your subscription ID listed along with the current score (in points), the max score and the score as percentage.\n4.\tTo return the status of all the security controls, select **New query**, paste the following KQL query and click on **Run query**:\n\n```\nSecurityResources\n| where type == 'microsoft.security/securescores/securescorecontrols'\n| extend SecureControl = properties.displayName, unhealthy = properties.unhealthyResourceCount, currentscore = properties.score.current, maxscore = properties.score.max\n| project SecureControl , unhealthy, currentscore, maxscore\n```\n### Exercise 5: Creating Governance Rules and Assigning Owners\nSecurity teams are responsible for improving the security posture of their organizations but they may not have the resources or authority to actually implement security recommendations. Assigning owners with due dates and defining governance rules creates accountability and transparency so you can drive the process of improving the security posture in your organization.\n\nFollow the progress for your created recommendations on the Security Posture page. Weekly email notifications to the owners and managers make sure that they take timely action on the recommendations that can improve your security posture and recommendations.\n\n1.

Moreover, you will learn how to enable the integration between Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Azure Sentinel. You will also learn how to auto provision the Azure Policy's Guest Configuration extension.\n\n### Exercise 1: Using continuous export\n\n1.\tOn Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs sidebar, click on **Environment settings**\n2. Select **Azure subscription 1**.\n\n   ![Environment settings](../Images/mdfc-envsettings.png?raw=true)\n\n3.\tFrom the sidebar, click on **Continuous export**.\n4.\tHere you can configure streaming export setting of Microsoft Defender for Cloud data to multiple export targets either Event Hub or Log Analytics workspace.\n5.\tSelect the **Log Analytics workspace** option.\n6.\tOn the Exported data types, select **Security recommendations, Secure score and Security alerts** ‚Äì as you can see, all recommendations, severities, controls, and alerts are selected.\n\n   ![Environment settings](../Images/mdfc-contexport.png?raw=true)\n\n7.\tOn the Export configuration, select a resource group: *asclabs*\n8.\tOn the Export target, select the target Log Analytics workspace: *asclab-la-xxx*\n9.\tClick on the **Save** button on the top menu.\n\n![Continuous export settings page](../Images/asc-continuous-export-settings.gif?raw=true)\n\n> Note: Exporting Microsoft Defender for Cloud's data also enables you to use experiences such as integration with 3rd-party SIEM and Azure Data Explorer.\n\n10.\tOn the Azure portal, navigate to **Log Analytics workspaces** service or [click here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.OperationalInsights%2Fworkspaces).\n11.\tClick on the **asclab-la-xxx** workspace.\n12.\tFrom the workspace‚Äôs sidebar, click on the **Logs** button.\n13.\tOn the welcome page, click on the **Get Started** button and then **close the Queries window**.\n14.\tFrom the left pane, expand, Security and Audit. Notice the following tables under Security and Audit:  `SecureScoreControls`, `SecureScores`, `SecurityAlert`, `SecurityNestedRecommendation`, `SecurityRecommendation` and `SecurityRegulatoryCompliance`.\n15.\tAt any point, administrators can run custom queries by using these tables provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n\n![Respective tables in the Log Analytics workspace](../Images/asc-continuous-export-tables.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Exercise 2: Integration with Azure Sentinel\n\n1.\tOn the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Sentinel** service or [click here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security_Insights/WorkspaceSelectorBlade).\n2.\tOn the Azure Sentinel workspaces, click on **+ Create** workspace button ‚Äì for this exercise we‚Äôll use the same Log Analytics workspace used by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n\n![](../Images/lab7sent.gif?raw=true)\n\n3.\tOn the **Add Azure Sentinel** to a workspace, select **asclab-la-xxx** workspace. Click **New** on the top bar, or click **Create Azure Sentinel**. \n4.\tAdding Azure Sentinel to workspace asclab-la-xxx is now in progress.

Wait for the connection status to be: `Connected`.\n![](../Images/mdfc-sentinelconfig.png?raw=true)\n\n9. Ensure that **Bi-directional sync** is **Enabled**.\n\n> **Note on Microsoft Defender for Cloud & Sentinel bi-directional alerts:**\nWhen you connect Microsoft Defender for Cloud to Azure Sentinel, the status of Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts that get ingested into Azure Sentinel is synchronized between the two services. So, for example, when an alert is closed in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, that alert will display as closed in Azure Sentinel as well. Changing the status of an alert in Microsoft Defender for Cloud \"won't\"* affect the status of any Azure Sentinel incidents that contain the synchronized Azure Sentinel alert, only that of the synchronized alert itself.<br/>\nEnabling this preview feature, bi-directional alert synchronization, will automatically sync the status of the original Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts with Azure Sentinel incidents that contain the copies of those Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts. So, for example, when an Azure Sentinel incident containing an Microsoft Defender for Cloud alert is closed, Microsoft Defender for Cloud will automatically close the corresponding original alert.\n\n### Exercise 3: Microsoft Defender for Cloud can now auto provision the Azure Policy's Guest Configuration extension (in preview)\nAzure Policy can audit settings inside a machine, both for machines running in Azure and Arc connected machines. The validation is performed by the Guest Configuration extension and client. Learn more in [Understand Azure Policy's Guest Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/governance/policy/concepts/guest-configuration).\nWith this update you can now set Microsoft Defender for Cloud to automatically provision this extension to all supported machines.\n1.\tIn Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud, click on **Environment Settings**.\n2.\tThen select **Auto provisioning** from the sidebar.\n3.\tHere, for **Guest Configuration agent**, toggle the status to be **On**.\n4.\tThen click **Save**.\n\n![](../Images/mdfc-guestconfigagent.png?raw=true)\n\nThe guest configuration agent checks machines running in Azure and Arc Connected Machines for security misconfigurations. Settings such as configuration of the operating system, application configurations, and environment settings are all validated.

The below extension should be turned on:\r\n\r\n![ContainerVA Extemsopm](../Images/enablecontainerva.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Exercise 1: Install Docker Desktop\r\n\r\nFirst you need to install Docker Desktop so that we can oush a vulnerable image to our existing Azure Container registry registy.\r\n\r\n1.\tNavigate to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)‚ÄØ \r\n2.  Download and install Docker, Check the system requirements, [Docker Requirements](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\r\n3.  After the installation, open PowerShell on your computer\r\n4. Verify your docker version by executing in PowerShell \r\n```\r\n    docker version‚Äã\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may see an output like the one below:\r\n\r\n\r\n![Docker Version in Powershell](../Images/1dockerversion.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exercise 2: Download vulnerable image from Docker Hub into the Container Registry\r\n\r\nNow you will use Docker to download a vulnerable image from it and push it into the Container Registry you created using the ARM template in Lab 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Azure Portal and open the Container Registry (named \"asclabcr####\") that you created through the ARM template in Lab 1.\r\n2. In the Overview of it, then please copy the Login server name only. \r\n![ACR server name](../Images/2acrserver.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tOpen PowerShell and run (where the NameOfServer is the one copied from above) the command below: <br />\r\n```\r\naz acr login --name NameOfServer\r\n```\r\nIn case you have not Azure CLI installed yet, please visit https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli for instructions. You will also need to login to your Azure subscription via the *az login* before running the command above.\r\n\r\nYou might see an output like \r\n\r\n![ACR login](../Images/3acrlogin.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Download vulnerable image from docker hub (which you can get more details at https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/web-dvwa/),\r\n\r\nby running the command below in Powershell:\r\n```\r\ndocker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n![ACR login](../Images/4dockerpullimage.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Check the image on your local repository by running the command below:\r\n```\r\ndocker images vulnerables/web-dvwa\r\n```\r\n![Docker images](../Images/5dockerimages.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n6. Create an alias of the image by runnig the following command (replace *secteach365* in following instructions with the name of your server that you copied above): \r\n```\r\ndocker tag vulnerables/web-dvwa secteach365.azurecr.io/vulnerables/web-dvwa\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Check again the image on your local repository by running the command below: \r\n```\r\ndocker images secteach365.azurecr.io/vulnerables/web-dvwa\r\n```\r\n![Docker local repository](../Images/6dockerlocalrepo.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Run docker push to upload the new image to the azure repository and generate image scan (it can take some time), using the command below: <br />\r\n```\r\ndocker push secteach365.azurecr.io/vulnerables/web-dvwa\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Docker push](../Images/7dockerpush.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n9. Then go to the Azure portal and find the Container registry you created.\r\n10. Go to Repositories in the Container Registry. Notice the vulnerable image is found in the ACR repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Image in ACR](../Images/8imageinacr.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exercise 3: Investigate the recommendation for vulnerabilities in ACR\r\n\r\nOnce a vulnerable image has been pushed to the Azure Container Registry registry, then Microsoft Defender for Cloud will start scanning the image for vulnerabilities using Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management. You will now look into the recommendation in Microsoft Defender for Cloud for this. \r\n \r\n 1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** in the **Azure Portal**.\r\n 2. Go to the **Recommendations** tab in Defender for Cloud.\r\n 3. In the **Resource type** filter, have it equal **Container Image**. <br />\r\n\r\n ![Recommendation for vulnerabilities in ACR](../Images/containerimageresource.png?raw=true)\r\n 4. Click on the recommendation **Container images in Azure registry should have vulnerability findings resolved** to get more details about it. The affected resource should be web-dvwa <br />\r\n ![Recommendation for vulnerabilities in ACR More details](../Images/containerimagerecommendation.png?raw=true)\r\n <br />\r\n 5. Look around at what's available in the recommendation. Take note of the Remediation Steps and the Findings tab. Click on the Findings tab to view all detected CVEs.\r\n<br />\r\n  ![Remediation Steps](../Images/fullcontainerimagerecommendation.png?raw=true)\r\n  ![Remediation Steps](../Images/findingstab.png?raw=true)\r\n  <br />\r\n 6.

The central security team decides which security policies will be implemented in the organization and who has permissions to control the policy set. They may also have the power to remediate non-compliant resources, and enforce resource isolation in case of a security threat or configuration issue. Workload owners on the other hand are mainly responsible for managing their cloud workloads, but need to follow the security  policies that the central team has deployed.\n\n| Action |\tWorkload owners\t| Central IT Security team\n| --- | :---: | :---:\nManage a cloud workload and its related resources |\t&#10003; |\t&#10005;\nDefine, monitor and enforce the company‚Äôs security policies to ensure the appropriate protections are in place |&#10003; <br /> (Only in addition to what the central team defines)|\t&#10003;\nNeed to understand the company‚Äôs security posture across workloads |\t&#10005; |\t&#10003;\nNeed to be informed of major attacks and risks |\t&#10005;|\t&#10003;\nAuto-remediate non-compliant resources |\t&#10005; |\t&#10003;\n\nOption A is most suitable for companies with a high level of automation, to ensure automated response processes to vulnerabilities and threats and maintain a high level of service availability.\n\n### Option B ‚Äì Security controls are deployed by workload owners\nDeploying security controls is done by the workload owners, they own the policy set and can therefore decide which security policies are applicable to their resources. They need be aware of, understand and act upon security alerts and recommendations for their own resources. The central security team on the other hand only acts as a controlling entity, without write access to any of the workload subscriptions or resources. However, they have insights into the overall security posture of the organization and they may hold the workload owners accountable for improving their security posture.\n\n| Action |\tWorkload owners\t| Central IT Security team\n| --- | :---: | :---:\nManage a cloud workload and its related resources |\t&#10003; |\t&#10005;\nDefine, monitor and enforce the company‚Äôs security policies to ensure the appropriate protections are in place |&#10003;|\t&#10005;\nNeed to understand the company‚Äôs security posture across workloads |\t&#10005; |\t&#10003;\nNeed to be informed of major attacks and risks |\t&#10003;|\t&#10003;\nDepending on the criticality of the workload, they may be responsible for 24/7 operations |\t&#10003; |\t&#10005;\n\nOption B is most suitable for organizations that need visibility into their overall security posture, but at the same time want to keep responsibility for security with the workload owners.\n\n\n> &#x26A0;  \n> This section is intended to give customers an idea of the responsibility models we see at both ends of the spectrum. These are by no means the only options; various combinations of these two options are possible and may even be more appropriate in a specific organization setup. Often customers will choose\n<br />\n\n## Step #2 - Assign the necessary RBAC permissions to the central security team\nCustomers need to make sure that the central security team has been assigned the necessary RBAC rights on the appropriate scope to follow the deployment steps in this document.

Activating Microsoft Defender for Cloud means that customers need to register their subscriptions to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Resource Provider *'Microsoft.Security'*. This action also triggers the assignment of the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative (id: `1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8`) on the subscription, if the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative has not already been assigned neither to the subscription itself nor to a management group higher up in the hierarchy.\nWe recommend that customers review each of the security recommendations in this default initiative to determine whether they are appropriate for the various subscriptions and resource groups in their organization. A list of the built-in policies and the available effect(s) in the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/azure-security-benchmark).\n\nAssigning the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative can happen on different scopes. The scope that customers choose depends on who in the organization wants to control the policy.\n* **Management Group scope**  \nThis scope is recommended for customers who want to centrally control the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative ([Option A](2-Roles-and-Permissions.md#option-a---security-controls-are-deployed--by-a-central-team) in the responsibility model). To assign the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative on a management group, customers needs to perform the following steps:\n    1. They need to assign the default MDC policy initiative to the management group.\nSee *‚ÄúAssign the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative to a management group‚Äù* in the automation options below.\n    2. Because the assigned policy initiative will only be evaluated for subscriptions that have already been onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, customers need to onboard each subscription within the management group. The automation options for this step are shown in section *‚ÄúEnable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on a subscription‚Äù*.\n    3. Some of the subscriptions may have been onboarded to MDC in the past and thus may already have the MDC default policy assigned at the subscription level. If this is not desired, customers can use an [Azure PowerShell script](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Powershell%20scripts/Remove%20ASC%20Default%20policy%20assignment) to remove the default assignments on the subscription level. However, customers should be aware that any customizations made to the subscription level policy by the workload owners will be lost in this process.\n*\t**Individual subscription scope**  \nThis scope is recommended if workload owners are responsible for deploying their own security controls ([Option B](2-Roles-and-Permissions.md#option-b--security-controls-are-deployed-by-workload-owners) in the responsibility model). To assign the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative on the subscription level, customers should onboard their subscription to Microsoft Defender for Cloud by using any of the options listed for *‚ÄúEnable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on a subscription‚Äù* in the automation section below. \n*\t**Management and individual subscription scope**  \nIt is possible to assign the MDC default initiative on both a management group and on individual subscriptions. For example, workload owners can decide to assign the default initiative to their subscription in addition to what a centrally governed policy initiative may define. In this case, Microsoft Defender for Cloud shows a list of aggregated recommendations and alerts and subscription controls can  override management group controls only if they are more restrictive (e.g., if they apply the policy effect \"DENY\" while on the management group the policy effect for that same policy is \"AUDIT\").\n\n### Automation options\n* Assign the Azure Security Benchmark policy initiative to a management group\n    * [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azpolicyassignment?view=azps-5.3.0)  \n` $definition = Get-AzPolicySetDefinition -Name 1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8\nNew-AzPolicyAssignment -Name 'MDCDefault' -PolicySetDefinition $definition`\n    * [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/policy/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest#az_policy_assignment_create)  \n`az policy assignment create --name ‚ÄòMDCDefault‚Äô ‚Äìpolicy-set-definition 1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8`\n    * [ARM Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/policyassignments)  \nTo create a *Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments* resource, add the following JSON to the resources section of your ARM template:  \n        ```json\n        {  \n          \"type\": \" Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments\",  \n          \"name\": \"MDCDefault\",  \n          \"apiVersion\": \"2019-09-01\",  \n          \"properties\": {  \n            \"policyDefinitionId\": \"1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8\"  \n          }  \n        }\n        ```\n    * [Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/policy/policy-assignments/create)\nMake a PUT request to https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/{policyAssignmentName}?api-version=2020-09-01\nwith the following request body  \n      ```json\n      {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"policyDefinitionId\": \"/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8\",\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n* Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on a subscription \n    * Azure Policy: [Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on your subscription](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fac076320-ddcf-4066-b451-6154267e8ad2)  \nTo register **existing** subscriptions to the free pricing tier that are currently not monitored by MDC, customers need to assign this  built-in policy to the appropriate scope, e.g. to the Root management group.\nTo register **newly created** subscriptions, customers have to create a remediation task for the policy. This is because subscriptions are not a top-level ARM resource (yet), so they currently do not trigger a policy evaluation when they are created.\nDepending on how often the organization creates new subscriptions, this is something that customers may want to automate and run on a regular basis. They can create the remediation task through\n        * [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/how-to/remediate-resources#create-a-remediation-task-through-azure-cli)\n        * [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/how-to/remediate-resources#create-a-remediation-task-through-azure-powershell)\n        * [Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/policy/remediations/create-or-update-at-management-group)\n    * [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-powershell-onboarding)\n    * [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/provider?view=azure-cli-latest#az_provider_register)\n    * [Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/providers/register)\n\n> *See the [Scheduled automation](../Misc/Scheduled-Automation.md) table for further implementation details*\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #4 - Choose standards for your compliance dashboard (recommended)\nWith the regulatory compliance dashboard in MDC, customers can compare the configuration of their resources with requirements in industry standards, regulations, and benchmarks. We recommend to select the highest scope for which the standard is applicable ‚Äì e.g., the Root MG - so that compliance data is aggregated and tracked for all nested resources. In essence, a regulatory standard is a set of policies that is applied to the customer‚Äôs chosen scope upon assignment.  \nSince assigning a regulatory compliance standard is normally a one-time task, most customers use the Azure Portal to do the assignment. Assigning a regulatory compliance standard with automation tools is possible, but while some of these built-in standards come with default parameters, some also require mandatory parameters that customers then need to specify in their scripts. An example can be found below.\n\n### Automation options\n\n* Azure Policy: Assign the appropriate policy via\n    * [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azpolicyassignment?view=azps-5.3.0)  \n` $definition = Get-AzPolicySetDefinition -Name 1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8\nNew-AzPolicyAssignment -Name 'MDCDefault' -PolicySetDefinition $definition`\n    * [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/policy/assignment?view=azure-cli-latest#az_policy_assignment_create)  \n`az policy assignment create --name ‚ÄòMDCDefault‚Äô ‚Äìpolicy-set-definition 1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8`\n    * [Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/policy/policy-assignments/create)  \nMake a PUT request to https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/{policyAssignmentName}?api-version=2020-09-01\nwith the following request body  \n      ```json\n      {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"policyDefinitionId\": \"/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8\",\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n    * [ARM Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.authorization/policyassignments)  \nTo create a *Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments* resource, add the following JSON to the resources section of your ARM template:  \n        ```json\n        {  \n          \"type\": \" Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments\",  \n          \"name\": \"MDCDefault\",  \n          \"apiVersion\": \"2019-09-01\",  \n          \"properties\": {  \n            \"policyDefinitionId\": \"1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8\"  \n          }  \n        }\n        ```\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #5 - Ensure resources are secure by default through Azure Policy and Azure Blueprints (recommended)\nCustomers should aim to improve their overall Secure Score by continuously driving security posture enhancements in their environment. This also includes provisioning new resources that are secure by default to prevent frequent fluctuations in the secure score. Having a solid Azure Governance enables customers to ensure that new resources that are deployed are going to have certain standards, patterns and configurations. To ensure proper governance, customers should leverage Azure Policy and Azure Blueprints. This will allow them to enforce policies (*DeployIfNotExists* policies) and reject deployments (Deny policies) of resources that are not following certain standards.  \nNew subscriptions that are being provisioned in the organization should also be correctly configured by default. They should be created in the correct management group to inherit the appropriate policy set.\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #6 - Assign custom policies (optional)\nCustomers can use Azure Policy to create custom policy definitions and receive recommendations if their environment doesn‚Äôt follow the policies they have created. We recommend to create the following resources on the widest scope required, e.g. the Root MG or any other suitable management group.\n\nThe steps to create custom policies in MDC are as follows:\n1.\tCreate one or more policy definitions with the *metadata/securityCenter* property and validate that they work as intended. An example of how to define a policy with this property can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/custom-security-policies#enhance-your-custom-recommendations-with-detailed-information).\n2.\tCreate a policy initiative that includes the created policy/policies and the `metadata` property with the value `{\"ASC\": \"true\"}`.\n3.\tAssign the policy initiative.\n\nAfter some time, MDC will detect the policies and they will appear in the recommendations as well as alongside the built-in initiatives in the regulatory compliance dashboard.\n\n### Automation options\n\n* **To create the policy definition(s)**\n    * [REST

Microsoft Defender for Cloud onboarding is already **audited** by Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs default initiative and counted towards the Secure Score. Subscription owners can therefore easily onboard their subscriptions to Microsoft Defender for Cloud by using the Quick Fix remediation available in the Microsoft Defender for Cloud portal experience.  \nIt is recommended though to **enforce** Microsoft Defender for Cloud for some or all of the plans, so that workload owners cannot override the settings. This can be done on the Root management group (or a different management group for higher granularity).\n\n### Automation options\n* **Azure Policy (recommended)**  \n[Enable Microsoft Defender plans](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Pricing%20&%20Settings/Azure%20Policy%20definitions/Azure%20Defender%20Plans)  \nYou can use DeployIfNotExists (DINE) policies to enforce one or more of the Microsoft Defender plans. If customers choose to deploy more than one of these policies, it makes sense to group them into a custom policy initiative and assign them to the appropriate scope. The appropriate scope could be the Root MG, to apply the policies to the whole subscription hierarchy, or a sub-MG to e.g. only deploy the policies to production subscriptions. In addition to that, customers can always define exclusions.  \nTo enable these plans on newly created subscriptions, customers have to create a remediation task for the policy. Again, customers may choose to use automation for this and create the remediation task through one of the following options:\n    * [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/how-to/remediate-resources#create-a-remediation-task-through-azure-cli)\n    * [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/how-to/remediate-resources%22%20/l%20%22create-a-remediation-task-through-azure-powershell)\n    * [Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/policy-insights/remediations/createorupdateatmanagementgroup)\n* **[REST API]()**  \nTo enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud using Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs REST API, make a PUT request with the following request body  \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"properties\": {\n       \"pricingTier\": \"Standard\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   for the following URL and add the relevant subscription ID and the pricingName:\nhttps://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/pricings/{pricingName}?api-version=2018-06-01  \nNote that {pricingName} can be any of the following:  \n    * VirtualMachines\n    * SqlServers\n    * AppServices\n    * StorageAccounts\n    * SqlServerVirtualMachines\n    * KubernetesService\n    * ContainerRegistry\n    * KeyVaults\n    * Dns\n    * Arm\n* **[Azure PowerShell]()**  \nUse the following Azure PowerShell command to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud, e.g. for virtual machines:  \n`Set-AzSecurityPricing -Name \"virtualmachines\" -PricingTier \"Standard\"`\n* **[Azure CLI]()**  \nUse the following Azure CLI command to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud, e.g. for virtual machines:  \n`az security pricing create -n VirtualMachines --tier 'standard'`\n* **[ARM Template]()**  \nTo create a *Microsoft.Security/pricings* resource, add the following JSON to the resources section of your ARM template, e.g for virtual machines:  \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \" VirtualMachines\",\n     \"type\": \"Microsoft.Security/pricings\",\n     \"apiVersion\": \"2018-06-01\",\n     \"properties\": {\n        \"pricingTier\": \"Standard\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n* **Logic App**  \nCustomers can deploy a scheduled LogicApp with write permissions to all subscriptions in scope and calls the API/PS to enable Microsoft Defender plans. \n\n> *See the [Scheduled automation](../Misc/Scheduled-Automation.md) table for further implementation details*\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #8 - Set security contact & email settings (recommended)\nTo receive notifications when MDC detects compromised resources, we advise that customers provide their contact information in MDC. Customers should decide ‚Äì depending on their responsibility model ‚Äì whether the security contact is the workload owner, the central IT security team, or both. They can specify multiple security contacts by separating them with a comma.  \nThe built-in policy definition in MDC only **audits** the existence of the setting. If customers instead would like to **enforce** the setting, they need to configure this by using one of the available options below. \n\n### Automation options\n* **Azure Policy** (recommended)  \nUse the following Azure Policy: [MDC email contact](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/blob/main/Pricing%20&%20Settings/Azure%20Policy%20definitions/ASC%20email%20contact/AscEmailContact-deployIfNotExists.json)\n* **[Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.security/set-azsecuritycontact?view=azps-5.0.0)**  \nUse the following Azure PowerShell command to set the security contact for a subscription:  \n`Set-AzSecurityContact -Name \"default1\" -Email \"john@contoso.com\" -Phone \"(214)275-4038\" -AlertAdmin -NotifyOnAlert`\n* **[Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/security/contact?view=azure-cli-latest)**  \nUse the following Azure CLI command to set the security contact for a subscription:\n`az security contact create -n \"default1\" --email 'john@contoso.com' --phone '(214)275-4038' --alert-notifications 'on' --alerts-admins 'on'`\n* **[Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/securitycenter/securitycontacts/create)**  \nTo create a security contact for your subscription using Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs REST API, make a PUT request for the following URL and add the relevant subscription ID and a name for the security contact:\nhttps://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/securityContacts/{securityContactName}?api-version=2017-08-01-preview  \nThe request body should include a JSON object with the following properties:  \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"properties\": {\n       \"email\": \"john@contoso.com\",\n       \"phone\": \"(214)275-4038\",\n       \"alertNotifications\": \"On\",\n       \"alertsToAdmins\": \"On\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n* **[ARM Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.security/2017-08-01-preview/securitycontacts)**  \nTo create a *Microsoft.Security/securityContacts* resource, add the following JSON to the resources section of your ARM template:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"name\": \"default1\",\n     \"type\": \"Microsoft.Security/securityContacts\",\n     \"apiVersion\": \"2017-08-01-preview\",\n     \"properties\": {\n       \"email\": \"john@contoso.com\",\n       \"phone\": \"(214)275-4038\",\n       \"alertNotifications\": \"On\",\n       \"alertsToAdmins\": \"On\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n> *See the [Scheduled automation](../Misc/Scheduled-Automation.md) table for further implementation details*\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #9 - Deploy required agents (recommended)\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud uses the Log Analytics agent to collect security data from virtual machines and to store it in a Log Analytics workspace(s). We recommend that customers automate the provisioning by e.g. using the Auto Provisioning functionality in MDC, so that the Log Analytics agent (for Windows or Linux) is automatically installed on all supported Azure VMs, and on any new ones that are created. Customers need to decide whether agents should be installed by the central security team or whether this is a task that the workload owners should perform. This decision may also depend on the Log Analytics workspace model that the customer chose. In case of a central workspace, it can also make sense to roll out the agent deployment in a centralized manner.   \nEither way, customers have two options to enable auto-provisioning: they can either use the Auto Provisioning feature in MDC or they can use Azure Policy. In both cases the customer needs to specify the Log Analytics workspace ID where the agent data should be sent to. If the customer chooses an existing workspace, they should make sure that the workspace has the Microsoft Defender for Cloud solution already installed on it.\nThe following agents are available to be deployed via MDC‚Äôs auto provisioning feature:\n\n\nAgent name |\tDescription\t| CSPM |\tCWPP\n| :---     |    :----     | :---: | :---: |\nLog Analytics agent for Azure VMs (sometimes referred to as the Microsoft Monitoring agent) |\tCollects security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and stores the data in your Log Analytics workspace for analysis. Microsoft Defender for Cloud depends on this agent for detecting security vulnerabilities and threats.\t| Required |\tRequired\nDependency agent |\tCollects and stores network traffic data and process dependencies. Is required to use Azure Monitor for VMs and the Service Map. Requires the Log Analytics agent to be installed on the same VM.\t| Recommended | Recommended\nPolicy Add-on for Kubernetes (Open Policy Agent)\t| Extends Gatekeeper v3, to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner. Requires Kubernetes v1.14 or later.\t| Required | \tNot required\n\n\n### Automation options\n*\t**[Azure Policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_Deploy_auto_provisioning_log_analytics_monitoring_agent_custom_workspace.json)** (recommended)  \nCustomers can use the built-in *DeployIfNotExists* policy to install the agent on any VM. The policy can be applied to an appropriate scope, so this option is preferred in case the customer needs to specify exclusions (in contrast, Auto Provisioning would automatically reinstall the agent on a VM even if somebody removed it manually).\n*\t**Auto Provisioning in MDC**  \nCustomers can enable Auto Provisioning and configure the workspace in the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Data Collection settings by using any of the following automation options: \n    *\tAzure PowerShell\n    *\tAzure CLI\n    *\tAzure REST API\n\n<br />\n\n### &#8680; Continue with the next steps: [Module 5 - Management](./5-Management.md)\n\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T13:25:35.253005"}

We recommend that customers stream their security alerts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud into Microsoft Sentinel for more insights. This gives customers the option to automatically generate incidents in Microsoft Sentinel from Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts.\n\n### Automation options:\n* **[Microsoft Defender for Cloud data connector in Microsoft Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-azure-security-center)** (recommended)  \nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud natively integrates with Microsoft Sentinel. We recommend the built-in connector to stream Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts from MDC into Microsoft Sentinel.\n    * [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/securityinsights/dataconnectors/createorupdate)   \n    To create the MDC data connector via REST API, make a `PUT` request for the following URL and replace the placeholders with the subscription ID, resource group name, and workspace name of your Sentinel environment:\nhttps://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/providers/Microsoft.SecurityInsights/dataConnectors/763f9fa1-c2d3-4fa2-93e9-bccd4899aa12?api-version=2020-01-01  \nThe request body should include a JSON object with the following properties:\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"kind\": \"AzureSecurityCenter\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"subscriptionId\": \"<subscriptionID>\",\n          \"dataTypes\": {\n            \"alerts\": {\n              \"state\": \"Enabled\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n      To connect all subscriptions in your tenant to Microsoft Sentinel, this [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/azure-security-center-auto-connect-to-sentinel/ba-p/1387539) gives detailed instructions on how to achieve that with an Azure Logic App.\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #11 - Prepare and deploy Logic Apps (recommended)\nAzure Logic Apps are an integral part when it comes to automatically responding to an event in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Logic Apps are a cloud service that helps customers to schedule, automate, and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows. Every logic app workflow starts with a trigger, which fires when a specific event happens, or when new available data meets specific criteria. In MDC, the following two triggers are supported:\n*\tWhen an Microsoft Defender for Cloud Recommendation is created or triggered\n*\tWhen an Microsoft Defender for Cloud Alert is created or triggered\n\nIt may make sense for a central team to provide workflow owners with proven Logic Apps that help them make their environment more secure. The Microsoft Defender for Cloud GitHub Repo already has an [extensive list of templates](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Workflow%20automation) that customers can start with. \nThe deployment scope of a Logic App is a subscription.\n\n### Automation options:\n* **[ARM Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-azure-resource-manager-templates-overview)**\n    * [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-logic-apps-azure-cli)\n    * [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.logicapp/new-azlogicapp?view=azps-5.1.0)\n* **[REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/logic/workflows/createorupdate)**\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #12 - Workflow Automation (recommended)\nAutomating the organization's monitoring and incident response processes can greatly improve the time it takes to investigate and mitigate security incidents. Workflow automation in Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps customers to automate their workflow for incident response by triggering Logic Apps on security alerts and recommendations. Workflow automation can be used both for external notification on recommendations or alerts (ITSM, DevOps, etc.) and for auto remediation.  \nSome of the top use cases for workflow automation include\n* Notifications & ticket creation\n    * Open a ticket in ServiceNow or JIRA for a new recommendation or alert\n    *\tSend a message on a Teams or Slack channel for a new recommendation or alert\n*\tAutomation at scale\n    * Automatically respond to an alert, e.g. block an IP address as a response to a brute force attack, or quarantine an infected VM\n    * Automatically remediate recommendations, e.g. install a vulnerability assessment solution on a VM\n\nA workflow automation is composed of two parts. So to deploy workflow automation, customers need to follow both of the following steps:\n1.\tCustomers need to create a Logic App, e.g. through the Logic App Designer or a template deployment (see [Step #11 - Prepare and deploy Logic Apps (recommended)](./5-Management.md#step-11---prepare-and-deploy-logic-apps-recommended) for more details). \n2.\tCustomers need to create a workflow automation resource in Microsoft Defender for Cloud and specify the required parameters and the Logic App that it should trigger.\n\n### Automation options:\n* **Azure Policy** (recommended)\n    * [Deploy Workflow Automation for Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2ff1525828-9a90-4fcf-be48-268cdd02361e)\n    * [Deploy Workflow Automation for Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f73d6ab6c-2475-4850-afd6-43795f3492ef)\n* **[REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/securitycenter/automations/createorupdate)**\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #13 - Export data for additional reporting (optional)\nCustomers that want to export security alerts, security recommendations and findings, Secure Score (in preview), and Regulatory Compliance (in preview) at the subscription or management group level for external reporting can use the **Continuous export** feature in MDC. For example, Export to a Log Analytics workspace is useful if they want to create dynamic and customizable reports in PowerBI or access and query Microsoft Defender for Cloud data in Azure Monitor. In the latter case, customers can start by using one of the available [Azure Monitor workbooks](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Workbooks) in the MDC GitHub repository.  \nFor tenant-wide reporting, customers can also use the **Microsoft Graph Security connector** of Power BI Desktop to connect to the Microsoft Graph Security API (this requires getting consent by the Azure AD global administrator). They can then build dashboards and reports to gain insights into their security-related alerts and secure scores.\n\n### Automation options:\n* **Continuous Export**\n    * Azure Policy (recommended)  \n    [Deploy export to Log Analytics workspace for Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts and recommendations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fffb6f416-7bd2-4488-8828-56585fef2be9)\n    * [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/securitycenter/automations/createorupdate)\n* **[Microsoft Graph Security Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-graph-security)**\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #14 - Export Microsoft Defender for Cloud data to other SIEM or ITSM solutions (optional)\nIf customers want to export Microsoft Defender for Cloud data for tracking with other monitoring tools in their environment, they can either use the Microsoft Graph Security API or the Continuous Export feature in MDC.  \nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud has out-of-the-box integration with **Microsoft Graph Security API**. No configuration is required and there are no additional costs. Customers can use this API to stream alerts from their entire tenant (and data from many other Microsoft Security products) into third-party SIEMs and other popular platforms such as Splunk, ServiceNow, QRadar, and others.  \n**Continuous Export** is a feature in Microsoft Defender for Cloud that lets customers fully customize what will be exported and where it will go. Exportable data types include alerts, recommendations, security findings, secure score (in preview), and regulatory compliance (in preview). Continuous Export to Azure Event Hub is useful if customers need integration with third-party SIEMs or Azure Data Explorer at the subscription or management group level.\n\n### Automation options:\n* **Microsoft Graph Security API** (recommended)  \n    *\tFor many third-party SIEMs and other popular platforms, customers can use native connectors to ingest alerts using the Microsoft Graph Security API. Customers can check the [list of connectors from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/security-integration#list-of-connectors-from-microsoft) or use one of the [connectors built by Microsoft partners](https://aka.ms/graphsecuritypartnerships).\n    *\tCustomers can also use the [supported integration options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/security-concept-overview#why-use-the-microsoft-graph-security-api) like the Graph Security SDK for C#, PowerShell scripts, or the Microsoft Graph Security connector in Azure Logic Apps to create an automated workflow.\n    *\t[Microsoft Graph Security REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0)\n\n* **Continuous Export to Azure Event Hub**  \n    * Azure Policy (recommended)  \n    [Deploy export to Event Hub for Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts and recommendations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fcdfcce10-4578-4ecd-9703-530938e4abcb)\n    * [Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/securitycenter/automations/createorupdate)\n\n<br />\n\n## Step #15 - Set alert suppression rules (optional)\nIf customers are using Microsoft Defender for Cloud, they will receive security alerts in Microsoft Defender for Cloud that are triggered by advanced detections. With suppression rules customers can tune the alerts they are getting from Microsoft Defender for Cloud and stop receiving alerts that are either being triggered too often to be useful or that have been identified as false positives. Nevertheless, customers should carefully check the potential impact of any suppression rule before implementing it.\n\n### Automation options:\n* **Azure Policy** (recommended)  \n[Deploy ‚Äì Configure suppression rules for Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_SuppressionRulesForAlerts_Deploy.json)\n* **[Azure REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/securitycenter/alertssuppressionrules/update)**  \nTo create an alert suppression rule via REST API, make a PUT request for the following URL and replace the placeholders with your subscription ID and a name for the alert suppression rule:\nhttps://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/alertsSuppressionRules/{alertsSuppressionRuleName}?api-version=2019-01-01-preview\nThe request body should include a JSON object with the following properties minimum:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"alertType\": \"<alertType>\",\n      \"reason\": \"<Reason>\", \n      \"state\": \"<Enabled|Disabled>\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n<br />\n\n### &#8680; Congratulations on completing the last module!
