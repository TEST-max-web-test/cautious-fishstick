It produces non-deterministic output and automatically seeds itself during object initialization using system entropy, so manual seeding is generally unnecessary and can weaken randomness if not done properly.\n\nThe default (no-argument) constructor of `SecureRandom` is recommended, as it uses the system-provided seed of appropriate length to ensure high entropy. Providing a seed (hardcoded or otherwise) to the constructor is [discouraged in the Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/weak-prng?source=studio#weak-prng-java-security-securerandom), because it risks creating deterministic output and undermining security.\n\nAlthough [the documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/SecureRandom?hl=en#setSeed(byte[])) says the provided seed normally supplements the existing seed, this behavior may differ if an [old security provider](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/06/security-crypto-provider-deprecated-in.html) is used. To avoid these pitfalls, ensure your app targets a modern Android version with an updated provider or explicitly configures a secure provider such as AndroidOpenSSL (or Conscrypt in newer releases).\n\n## Other Languages\n\nConsult the standard library or framework documentation to find the API that exposes the operating system's cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator. This is usually the safest approach, provided there are no known vulnerabilities in that library's random number generation. For example, see the [Flutter/Dart issue](https://www.zellic.io/blog/proton-dart-flutter-csprng-prng/) as a reminder that some frameworks may have known weaknesses in their PRNG implementations.\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T22:04:43.796558"}

To determine whether all logging functions from the `android.util.Log` class have been removed, check the ProGuard configuration file (proguard-rules.pro) for the following options (according to this [example of removing logging code](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard/manual/examples#logging \"ProGuard\\'s example of removing logging code\") and this article about [enabling ProGuard in an Android Studio project](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#enable \"Android Developer - Enable shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization\")):\n\n```default\n-assumenosideeffects class android.util.Log\n{\n  public static boolean isLoggable(java.lang.String, int);\n  public static int v(...);\n  public static int i(...);\n  public static int w(...);\n  public static int d(...);\n  public static int e(...);\n  public static int wtf(...);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the example above only ensures that calls to the Log class' methods will be removed. If the string that will be logged is dynamically constructed, the code that constructs the string may remain in the bytecode. For example, the following code issues an implicit `StringBuilder` to construct the log statement:\n\nExample in Java:\n\n```java\nLog.v(\"Private key tag\", \"Private key [byte format]: \" + key);\n```\n\nExample in Kotlin:\n\n```kotlin\nLog.v(\"Private key tag\", \"Private key [byte format]: $key\")\n```\n\nThe compiled bytecode, however, is equivalent to the bytecode of the following log statement, which constructs the string explicitly:\n\nExample in Java:\n\n```java\nLog.v(\"Private key tag\", new StringBuilder(\"Private key [byte format]: \").append(key.toString()).toString());\n```\n\nExample in Kotlin:\n\n```kotlin\nLog.v(\"Private key tag\", StringBuilder(\"Private key [byte format]: \").append(key).toString())\n```\n\nProGuard guarantees removal of the `Log.v` method call. Whether the rest of the code (`new StringBuilder ...`) will be removed depends on the complexity of the code and the [ProGuard version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6009078/removing-unused-strings-during-proguard-optimisation \"Removing unused strings during ProGuard optimization \").\n\nThis is a security risk because the (unused) string leaks plain text data into memory, which can be accessed via a debugger or memory dumping.\n\nUnfortunately, no silver bullet exists for this issue, but one option would be to implement a custom logging facility that takes simple arguments and constructs the log statements internally.\n\n```java\nSecureLog.v(\"Private key [byte format]: \", key);\n```\n\nThen configure ProGuard to strip its calls.\n\n## Custom Logging\n\nYou can implement a custom logging facility and disable it at once only for the release builds.\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T22:04:43.902168"}

An organization may be required to comply with certain federal and state regulations, depending on its location, the type of business it conducts, and the nature of any private data it handles. Regulations may include Safe Harbor Privacy Framework [REF-340], Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) [REF-341], Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [REF-342], General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [REF-1047], California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) [REF-1048], and others.\n\n## Phase: Architecture and Design\n\nCarefully evaluate how secure design may interfere with privacy, and vice versa. Security and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other.\n\n- From a security perspective, all important operations should be recorded so that any anomalous activity can later be identified.\n- However, when private data is involved, this practice can in fact create risk. Although there are many ways in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust.\n\nProgrammers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources. However, even if access to certain resources is restricted, this does not guarantee that the individuals who do have access can be trusted.\n\n## References\n\n- [REF-340] U.S. Department of Commerce. \"Safe Harbor Privacy Framework\". <https://web.archive.org/web/20010223203241/http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

For an attacker to exploit WebView debugging, they must have physical access to the device (e.g., a stolen or test device) or remote access through malware or other malicious means.

Even though Google doesn't enforce a specific `minSdkVersion`, [as they do with the `targetSdkVersion`](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11926878), it's crucial to understand the implications of setting a low `minSdkVersion`, as it **directly impacts security**, **exposes users to vulnerabilities**, and **prevents the app from leveraging critical security protections**.\n\n## Clarifying the Difference: `targetSdkVersion` vs `minSdkVersion`\n\n- `targetSdkVersion`: Defines the highest API level the app is _designed_ to run on. The app _can_ run on lower API levels, but it won't necessarily take advantage of all new security enforcements.\n- `minSdkVersion`: Defines the lowest API level the app is _allowed_ to run on. This is crucial because many security features are only available on devices running a certain API level or higher. If you set a low `minSdkVersion`, your app **completely misses out on these protections** on older devices.\n\nEven if you set a high `targetSdkVersion`, the app can still run on older devices **without** the latest security improvements. If you set `targetSdkVersion=33` (Android 13) but `minSdkVersion=21` (Android 5), the app can still be installed on Android 5 devices, **which lack years of critical security updates**. Malware on these older devices can exploit missing security features that app-level code alone cannot address, as evidenced by vulnerabilities listed in the [Android Security Bulletins](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin).\n\nWhile increasing `minSdkVersion` may slightly reduce the number of devices your app can run on, **it significantly enhances security** by ensuring that **all users have a baseline level of protection**.\n\n## Common Misconceptions\n\nThere are many misconceptions about the `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` in Android development. The Android documentation sometimes mentions \"targeting\" when they actually mean \"running on.\" For example:\n\n> [Opt out of cleartext traffic](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-config#CleartextTrafficPermitted): The guidance in this section applies only to apps that target Android 8.1 (API level 27) or lower. Starting with Android 9 (API level 28), cleartext support is disabled by default.\n\nThe note says the guidance applies to apps **targeting API 27 or lower**. But in reality, **even if an app targets API 28+ but is running on an older Android version (below API 28), cleartext traffic is still allowed** unless explicitly disabled. Developers might assume that just increasing `targetSdkVersion` automatically blocks cleartext, which is incorrect.\n\n## Notable Android Platform Security Improvements Over Time\n\n- Android 4.2 (API level 16) in November 2012 (introduction of SELinux)\n- Android 4.3 (API level 18) in July 2013 (SELinux became enabled by default)\n- Android 4.4 (API level 19) in October 2013 (several new APIs and ART introduced)\n- Android 5.0 (API level 21) in November 2014 (ART used by default and many other features added)\n- Android 6.0 (API level 23) in October 2015 (many new features and improvements, including granting; detailed permissions setup at runtime rather than all or nothing during installation)\n- Android 7.0 (API level 24-25) in August 2016 (new JIT compiler on ART)\n- Android 8.0 (API level 26-27) in August 2017 (a lot of security improvements)\n- Android 9 (API level 28) in August 2018 (restriction of background usage of mic or camera, introduction of lockdown mode, default HTTPS for all apps)\n- **Android 10 (API level 29)** in September 2019 (enforces TLS 1.3, access location \"only while using the app\", device tracking prevention, improve secure external storage)\n    -

This ensures the content is loaded in a secure, same-origin environment and avoids exposing local files to potential cross-origin attacks.\n\nIf you must allow the WebView to load local files using the `file://` scheme, consider the following:\n\n- For apps with a `minSdkVersion` that has secure defaults for WebView file access methods, ensure that these methods are **not used** and the default values are preserved. Alternatively, explicitly set them to `false` to guarantee the WebView does not allow local file access:\n    - `setAllowFileAccess(false)`\n    - `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(false)`\n    - `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(false)`\n\n- For apps with a `minSdkVersion` that **does not have secure defaults** for these methods (e.g., older API levels), ensure that the above methods are **explicitly** set to `false` in your WebView configuration.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [official Android documentation on loading local content securely](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/load-local-content), especially the section on [\"Things to avoid\"](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/load-local-content#antipatterns).\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T22:04:44.982460"}

User-facing error messages should remain generic, while controlled logging is reserved for developers. The [OWASP DevGuide](https://devguide.owasp.org/en/12-appendices/01-implementation-dos-donts/06-exception-error-handling/) reinforces these principles with a focus on not disclosing internal details to end users, not disclosing sensitive user data to developers, and ensuring secure failure modes that do not weaken authentication or authorization.\n\n- **Avoid leaking sensitive information**: Error messages shown to users should be generic and not reveal internal details. Logs should be sanitized to remove sensitive data and restricted to authorized personnel. The official [Log Info Disclosure](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/log-info-disclosure) guidance warns against including sensitive data or stack traces in production logs and recommends sanitization and reduced verbosity.\n- **Fail securely**: Exceptions must not weaken security controls. Any failure in security checks should result in a **deny** outcome, blocking the action rather than allowing weaker assumptions or insecure fallbacks. Security mechanisms should default to denying access until explicitly granted, since fail-open paths are a common attack vector.\n- **Validate strictly and abort on errors**: Unexpected formats or values should be treated as errors. Do not continue in a partially verified state. For example, if a network call succeeds at the transport layer but fails validation at the application layer, processing must stop. If the validation fails, do not try to sanitize the data to make the validation succeed.\n\nSee these resources for more details:\n\n- [\"OWASP - Fail Securely\"](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fail_securely)\n- [\"OWASP - Improper Error Handling\"](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling)\n- [\"CWE-636 - Not Failing Securely ('Failing Open')\"](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/636.html)\n", "timestamp": "2025-10-21T22:04:46.213041"}
