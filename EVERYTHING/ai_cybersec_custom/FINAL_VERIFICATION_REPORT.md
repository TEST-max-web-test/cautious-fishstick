## 💡 Recommendations

### For Current 47MB Dataset:

**Option 1: Train with Current Data (Recommended)**
```
✅ Best for: Quick validation and testing
✅ Model will work but may underfit
✅ Good for: Proof of concept
✅ Training time: 12-24 hours on A100
✅ Expected quality: Good but not optimal
```

**Option 2: Use Smaller Model**
```
✅ Better data-to-parameter ratio
✅ Use 10-30M parameter model instead
✅ Will perform better with current data
✅ Training time: 4-8 hours
✅ Expected quality: Better than 223M on this data
```

**Option 3: Collect More Data**
```
⏰ Let scraper continue running (2-4 more hours)
⏰ Will collect 200-300MB more data
✅ Better suited for 223M model
✅ Higher quality results
⏰ Adds 2-4 hours to timeline
```

### Recommended Path:

1. **Immediate**: Train 223M model with current 47MB data
   - Get working model quickly
   - Validate architecture and training pipeline
   - Can always fine-tune with more data later

2. **Parallel**: Continue scraping in background
   - Collect additional data
   - Filter and add to corpus
   - Fine-tune model with expanded dataset
