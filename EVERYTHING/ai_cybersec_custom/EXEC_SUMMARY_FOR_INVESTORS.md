- **Overfitting**: Dropout (10%), weight decay (0.1), early stopping
- **Training instability**: Gradient clipping, mixed precision, checkpointing
- **Memory limits**: Gradient checkpointing, small batch sizes

### Timeline Risks
- **Data collection delay**: Multiple parallel sources, automated pipeline
- **Training failures**: Regular checkpoints, can resume from failures
- **Quality issues**: Continuous filtering and monitoring

## SUCCESS METRICS
